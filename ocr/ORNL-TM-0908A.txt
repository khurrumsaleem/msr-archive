PREFACE

The report on the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE) has been
arranged into twelve major parts as shown below. Each of these covers
a particular phase of the project, such as the design, safety analysis,
operating procedures, etc. An attempt has thus been made to avoid much
of the duplication of material that would result if separate and inde-
pendent reports were prepared on each of these major aspects.

Detailed references to supporting documents, working drawings, and
other information sources have been made throughout the report to make
it of maximum value to ORNL personnel. Fach of the major divisions of
the report contains the bibliographical and other appendix information
necessary for that part.

The final voliumes of the report, Part XIT, contain rather extensive
listings of working drawings, specifications, schedules, tabulations,
etc. These have been given a limited distribution.

Most of the reference material is available through the Division
of Technical Information Extension, Atomic Energy Commission, P.0. Box
62, Oak Ridge, Tennessee. For material not available through this source,
such as inter-ILaboratory correspondence, etc., special arrangements can
be made for those having a particular interest.

None of the information contained in this report is of a classified
nature.

All the reports are listed below.

MSRE DESIGN AND OPERATIONS REPORT

Part VIII
OPERATING PROCEDURES

R. H. Guymon

1. Introduction

The first draft of the operating procedures was written during design
and construction of the reactor as an aid in producing a complete, work-
able design. This draft was then used during operator training, for
prenuclear shakedown of the reactor, and for the zero-power nuclear
experiments. During this time, changes were made in the master copy as
the need arose. The present issue is the result of a comprehensive
review and updating, and incorporates all changes and additions found

necessary up to the beginning of power operation.

1A EXPLANATION OF THE OPERATING PROCEDURES

The- prime purpose of this part of the MSRE Design and Operations
Report is to aid in the training of operating personnel and to provide
readily available reference material needed for operation. Details which
are not thought to be needed in normal operation are omitted. These can
be found in the other parts of the Design and Operations report and in the
material referenced in Section_lB.

Section 2, Nuclear Aspects of Operation, gives a simplified discussion

of basic nuclear facts, explains the nuclear behavior of the MSRE and sets
down the wvalues of characteristic properties.

Section 3, Operation of the Auxiliary'Systems, covers in detail the

operation of each auxiliary system. In order to avoid repétition with
section 4, not all line, valve, switch or instrument numbers are enumerated,
but often they are referred to in general terms or as groups (such as

"The cooling water is turned on to all space coolers.") However, when

it adds to clarity the numbers are also given. In general, flow rates,
utemperatures, pressures, etc., are not given but are covered by the

startup check lists, log sheets, run instructions, and daily shift in-
structions.

Section 4, Auxiliary Systems Startup Check ILists, covers the minute

details necessary in getting the auxiliary systems ready for startup.

The position of each valve and switch is listed, and a test for each
instrument under actual or simulated operating conditions is described
in detail. The check lists are written in logical order for each system;
however, since there is an interdependence between systems, it may be
necessary to do portions of one check list before portions of another.
When logical sequence permits, all operations in a physical area are
listed together in order to expedite completion of these lists. All
items in this section must be completed before each startup unless the
omission is approved by the operations chief.

Section 5, Reactor Start Up, covers the actual startup of the

reactor and operation at power. FEach step is outlined in detail. All

instrument settings and switch and valve positions are given. This
Approved by /ﬁﬁéﬁ%&m\ 2
9/2/65

section is written in chronological sequence and tells what is to be done,
when it can be done, why certain precautions are necessary, and suggests
corrective action in case of difficulty.

Section 6, Sampling and Adaptations, describes all samples which are

to be taken, frequency of sampling, analyses to be made and allowable
limits. Details of sampling procedures are given. 5alt additions,
chemical additions, etc., are described.

Section 7, Heat Balance, describes the method used to determine the

power being produced by the reactor.

Section 8, Instrument Calibrations and Operation, gives the procedure

used to periodically check the safety circuits and other instrumentation
and assure that they are functioning properly.

Section 9, Unusual Operating Conditions, attempts to anticipate

possible difficulties and suggest corrective action to be taken.

Section 10, Reactor Shutdown, describes in detail normal and

special shutdowns of the reactor and lists possible causes for a shutdown
and actions to be taken by operating personnel.

Section 11, Shutdown Operations, provides procedures for operational

activities involved while the reactor is shut down including graphite
sampling.

Section 12, Routine Observations, describes the taking of data,

marking of charts, storing of data, logging equipment, and other routine
duties of the shift personnel.

Section 13, Maintenance and Changes, describes the methods used for

getting maintenance done safely and for making modification to the system

or to approved documents.

SECTION 2

NUCLEAR ASPECTS OF OPERATION

Nuclear safety has been designed into the MSRE. Furﬁhermore,
qualified operators must have a working understanding of the consid-
erations involved in nuclear operation, in order to operate the reactor
in a manner which is both safe and efficient.

The purpose of this section is to provide information to which the
operator can conveniently refer for a review of the nuclear aspects
of the operation of the MSRE. First, there is a simplified explanation
of how uranium can be made to produce heat in a controlled manner through
a nuclear fission chain reaction. Then the specific characteristics of
the MSRE are discussed briefly. This includes a discussion of how the
nuclear instrumentation and controls work, how the nuclear power responds
to the controls, and why precautions must be taken in the management of
the fuel. The subject of radiation safety and control is not covered
completely, since adequate treatment would be lengthy and is readily

available to the operator in other publications.

2 ATOMIC STRUCTURE

The world around us is made up of a wide variety of substances.

Each "chemically pure" substance is comprised of molecules, each identical
with all otheré of that substance. The molecules in turn are combinations
of atoms, an extremely small unit of matter (~lO-8cm). An atom contains

a nucleus, whose diameter is only about 1/10,000 of that of the atom,

but which contains nearly all of its mass. Around the nucleus are orbiting
electrons, negatively charged particles with little mass. The nucleus,
which is positively charged, contains protons and neutrons. The nuclear
particles (nucleons) are about equal in mass, but the proton has a positive
charge, equal in magnitude to the negative charge of the electron, while

the neutron is uncharged. The atom is neutral, having as many negative
g2 o

electrons as positive protons.

A nuclide is comprised of all atoms having the same number of
neutrons and the same number of protons. WNaturally occurring nuclides
range from normal hydrogen, whose nucleus is simply a proton, to uranium-
238, which has 92 protons and 146 neutrons in its nucleus.

Atoms of any one element all have the same number of protons énd
orbital electrons. Because chemical properties are determined by the
orbital electrons, all atoms of an element are chemically alike. But
not all atoms of an element necessarily have the same number of neutrons.
Nuclides of the same element with different numbers of neutrons are called
isotopes of that element.

An exaﬁple of isotopes is shown in Fig. 2A-]1, which depicts
schematically the two isotopes of lithium. Both have 3 protons and 3
el$ctrons, and behave alike chemically. But Li6 has 3 neutrons and

properties--Li is 30,000 times more likely to absorb a neutron, and it is

for this reason that separated LiT is used in the MSRE salt manufacture.

(Natural lithlum is comprised of 92.5% Li7 and T.5% Li6.)

The positively charged nucleus is held together by extremely strong
short-range forces, while the electrons are much less fightly bound to the
atom by attraction to the positive nucleus. In chemical reactions, which"
involve the orbital electrons, the energy for a reaction is on the order
of a few electron volts (ev). Much more energy (on the order of millions
of electron volts) is involved in changes in the nucleus because of the
stronger forces of attraction. 1Indeed, so much energy is involved that
a nuclear reaction can produce a significant change in mass of the re-
acting pérticles as mass is converted to energy, or vice versa. (The
conversion follows Einstein's famous E = mcg.)

Consider Figure 2A-2, which is a plot of the mass per nucleon (the
ratio of nuclear mass to atomic number, or number of nucleons) against
atomic number. It is seen that the average mass of nucleons in nuclides
of intermediate number is significantly less than the averages at either
end. A consequence of this is that if heavy nuclides can be split to
form lighter fragments the total mass decreases. The difference appears
in the form of energy. This is the basis of power from nuclear fission.

(Fusion involves building up from the low-A end of the scale.)

3 RADIOACTTVITY AND RADIATION

The number of nucleons in naturally occurring muclides covers a wide

range, from 1 to 238. But if one plots the number of neutrons against
the number of protons in each naturally occurring nuclide, it is found

that all of the points lie in a rather narrow band as shown in Fig. 2A-3.

FPig. 2A-3 DNuclear Composition of Naturally Occurring Nuclides

Some nuclides found in nature are radioactive; that is, the nucleil
may spontaneously change, or "décay.'" ©Nearly all of these naturally
radiocactive nuclides are at the heavy end of the band and decay by the
emission of an alpha particle from the nucleus. An alpha particle
consists of two protons and two neutrors (identical with a helium-4
nucleus), so this type of decay produces a nuclide nearer the stable band.

The fact that the band in Fig. 2A-3 is curved has an important
implication. If a heavy nuclide is split, or fissioned, the fission
£ragment nuclei usually have a composition near the straight line joining
the original point to the origin. Thus the primary fission products
usually lie outside the stable band, on the side of too many neutrons,
and are radioactive. The tendency is for change toward the stable band,
sometimes by emission of a neutron from the nucleus but much more often
by the process called betg decay. In this process a high-speed electron
(beta particle) is emitted from the nucleus, reducing the number of neutrons

by one and adding one to the number of protons.

Another process (besides fission) which can prodnce radioactive
nuclides is neutron absofption. A passing neutron may be absorbed in
almost any nucleus (the probability of absorption varies widely,
howevér). When fhis happens, a certain amount of energy, called the
binding energy of the added neutron, is immediately released, usually in
the form of gamma rays, called capture gammas. The new nucleus, containing
the added neutron, may be stable or it may be radioactive. Radioactivity
produced by neutron absorption is called induced radioactivity, or the
material is said to be activated. TInduced radioactivity is usually in
the form of beta decay.

Beta decay is always accompanied by the emission of a neutrino. The
neutrino is a particle with very small mass, which 1s so unlikely to
interact with matter that it is extremely difficult to detect. Neu-
trinoés are important in a reactor only in that they éarry away a sig-
nificant amount of energy in a form which is not recoverable.

Most radioactive decay processes, whether they be alpha decay or
beta decay, are accompanied by the emission of gamma rays, calied decay
gammas.

Radiocactlive decay is a statistical process, that is, the rate can
be predicted only for large numbers of nuclei. The probability that a
nucleus will decay in a given interval of time is.called the decay
constant, usually represented by A. Thus, when there are N nuclei of a
of a radicactive nuclide present, the fate of decay is NA disintegrations
Per unit time. If there are N nuclei at a particular time, then a time t
later there will be No e_kt nuclei remaining.

-At
N =N, e

This formula means that the number of nuclei present (and the rate of
disintegration) decreases by a certain fraction in any equal lengths of
time. The time required to decrease by a factor of two is the half-life.
Half'-lives of fission products range from a fraction of a second to many
years. Naturally occurriﬁg radicactive nuclides are usually very long

lived. For examplec decays by alpha emission with a half life of

TO0 million years.

Amounts of radicactive material are usually expressed in units of ¢
curies. A curie is defined as the mmount of material which undergoes
3.7 x lOlO disintegrations per second.

Alpha particles, beta particles and gamma rays all deposit energy
and cause local damage along their path through matter. This can cause
problems of heating, changes in physical properties of materials and
bioclogical injury.

Charged particles give up energy as they move through matter by the
process of ionization. The charged particles and the orbital electrons
exert forces on each other which slow down the moving particle and draw .
many electrons from their atoms, leaving positively charged atoms oxr
ions. Thousands of ion pairs must be formed in the course of stopping
an alpha particle or a beta particle, but in ordinary matter this will
occur in a short distance. Thus charged particles have a limited range.
For example, a 1-Mev beta can travel O.1lL in. in water (or flesh).
Alpha particles produce more dense ionization, and the range of a l-Mev
alpha in water is only 0.0002 in.

Gamma rays do not ionize directly since they are electiromagnetic
vadiation with no charge. They interact through any of three processes
to produce high~speed electrons which in turn ionize the medium. The
gammas always travel at the speed of light, but their energy can be
decreased, even to zero, by scattering collisions with electrons. (Tt
is useful for some purposes to think of gammas as particles since they -
have direction, energy and momentum and can have collisions.) The |
linear rate of energy loss by gammas in matter is far less than that of
charged particles. Consequently they do not have a definite range.
Instead the intensity of a stream of gammas falls off exponentially with
distance through matter.

L  THE FISSTION PROCESS

There are some nuclides in which the nucleus will fission, or split
into a number of smaller particles, when a neutron collides with it.

Some nuclides, such as U238, will fission only if the neutron is travelling
at very high speed; neutrons of any energy will cause certain other
nuclides to fission. U235, which is fissionable with neutrons of any
energy, is the fuel in the MSEE.

In the fission process, a neutron enters a nucleus, causing so much
disturbance that the forces which hold the nucleus together are overcome
and the nucleus splits into two or more smaller nuclei or fission frag-
ments. The exact manner in which U235 nuclei split is not always the
same, but in most fissions the nucleus (atomic mass 235) bresks up into
two unequally-sized particles having atomic mass numbers around 95 and
140. Tn addition to the fission fragment nuclei, there are many other
smaller particles resulting from the fission. These are bets particles,

gamma rays, neutrinos and neutrons. On the average, the fission of a
U235 nucleus gives off 2.5 neutrons and it 1s this fact which makes a

chain reaction possible, since these new neutrons, if they are properly
handled, can cause other fissions.

Nuclear fission is important because of the relatively large amount
of energy released in the process, compared to the energy available from
chemical reactions, which involve only the loosely bound orbital electrons.
To illustrate, when a carbon atom burns, or combines chemically with an
oxygen molecule, the energy released is 4 ev. In contrast, when a single
U°3° micleus fissions, the total energy released is about 200,000,000 ev
(200 Mev). The distribution of this energy is shown in Table 2A-1. All
of this energy eventually appears as heat, but not all of it in places
where it can be utilized. The fission fragments are all slowed down and
stopped within a few thousandths of an inch, so their energy appears as
heat essentially at the point of the fission. Beta particles have a
range of only an inch or less. Neutrinoes, on the other hand, travel such
great distances without creating heat (or leaving any trace) that as far
as power production is concerned they might as well not even exist. A

fission neutron usually gives up its energy in a series of collisions
‘<3€y9f

7/21/65

along a zigzag path a few feet long; A gamma ray may penetrate as much
as several feet in a straight line before its energy is converted to
heat. The available energy in Table 2A-1 is the estimated amount which
produces useful heat in the MSRE*. The rest of the energy escapes and

appears as heat in the shield or elsewhere outside the reactor.

Although most of the fission heat is generated practically instanta-

neously, the beta particles and gamma rays from the fission products are

*the that Table 2A-1 lists only the energy directly produced by fission.
In a reactor there is also energy produced by non-fission capture of
neutrons which produces gamma rays at the instant of capture and gamma
and beta rays by the decay of the capture products. The ratio of
captures to fissions depends on the reactor; in the MSRE this source
releases about 6 Mev/fission, nearly all of which appears as useful

heat.

liberated over a period of time by radicactive decay. The fission prcducts
are a mixture of nuclides with half lives ranging from a fraction of

a second to many years. Thus, in a nuclear reactor the heat source from
the fission product decay decreases after the fission reaction is stopped,
rapldly at first, then more slowly and never completely dying out. The
energy release after shutdown, called "afterheat", is a serious problem

in high-power reactors.

Nearly all of the fission neutrons, are emitted almost instantaneously,
but a few are liberated by the decay of certain short-lived fission product
isotopes, called precursors. These delayed neutrons comprise only 0.6L4
per cent of the total neutrons, and they are nearly all emitted within
the first minute after a fission, but they play an important part in
making the fission chain reaction more easily controlled, as will be
seen later.

Although the amount of energy produced per fission is large compared
with that in chemical reactions, the absolute amount is so tiny that an
extremely large number of fisslons must occur to produce a useful amount
of heat. (198 Mev is only 3.0 x lO-lh Btu. At 198 Mev/fission, the
fission rate required to produce 1 watt is 3.16 x 101° fissions/sec.)

To illustrate, when the MSRE is operating at a nuclear power of one

megawatt, about one trillion (1012) fissions occur each second in each

cubic inch of fuel salt. The important consequence of such high fission
rates is that the laws of probability apply very well, so the analysis
of the nuclear behavior of a reactor can be based upon probabilities. .

5 CROSS SECTTONS AND REACTION RATES

Tn the calculation of rates of reaction between nuclei and neutrons,
use is made of probabilities expressed in terms of nuclear cross sections.
The following illustration is helpful in understanding the significance
of the term "cross section". Consider a thin element of volume containing
a number of spheres (nuclei) as shown in Fig. 2A-4. TIf a neutron, which
can be pictured as a tiny projectile, enters perpendicularly to a face,
the chance that it will collide with a sphere is equal to the fraction
of the area o0f a face covered by the circles which are the projections

of the spheres.

Since this is the probability that a neutron will suffer a collision

while traveling a distance dx, the probability per unit distance traveled
is found by dividing by dx. This probability of collision per unit
neutron path length, No, is called the macroscopic cross section,

symbolized by Z, with dimensions of reciprocal length.

Now picture a box containing nuclei and randomly moving neutrons
as shown in Fig. 2A-5. The combined distance traveled each second by
all the neutrons in the box is a3nv° (Assume the neutron density in
the box is not changing, so if some of the original neutrons leave,
others come in to take their place.) The path length per unit volume

per second is a”nv divided by the volume, a3. This quantity is called

the neutron flux, ¢.

The foregoing picture of cross sections is inadeguate in several
respects.

In the first place, the experimentally determined cross sections
show that for most isotopes the effective neutron target area, o, is
many times the actual nrg of the nucleus. Further more, ¢ varies with
neutron speed, usually in such a way that the nucleus appears to present
to passing neutrons a target which becomes larger the slower the neutron.

Another difficulty with the simple picture is that a neutron may
undergo any of several different reactions with nuclei of a particular
type; The fission reaction has already been mentioned. Another reaction
is radiative capturé, in which the neutron is absorbed and a gamma ray
is emitted from the ndcleus. A neutron may also undergo an elastic
scattering or "billiard ball' collision with a nmucleus. The nucleus
has a different probability or cross section for each type of reaction,
and in geheral 2ll the cross sections vary with neutron velocity. Cross
sections for different reactions are identified by subscripts; f for
fission, ¢ for radiative capture, a for absorption, s for scattering and

%
+ for total .

* .
Absorption includes both fission and radiative capture. Total includes

absorption plus scattering. Thus o5 = op + Oy and o, = 0, + O
2A-1k4

In view of the inadequacy of the "hard sphere' picture of neutron-

Approved by 7 -

nucleus collisions, it is perhaps best to think purely in terms of
probability. The probability that a neutron, while passing a unit

distance through a region inhabited by N nuclei per unit volume, will
undergo a particular reaction is No, where ¢ is a measure of probability
whose magnitude depends upon the type of nuclei, the type of reaction and
the neutron speed. The probabilities are additive, i. e., the probability
that a reaction of some sort will occur is the sum of the probabilities for
reactions of all the possible types. For exampie, in a region contaihing

6 THE FISSION CHAIN REACTION IN AN INFINITE REACTOR
235

Because each U fission releases, on the average, 2.5 neutrons

the feasibility of a self-sustaining chain reaction would at first seem
obvious, &ince to maintain such a reaction only one of the 2.5 neutrons
need cause another fission. However, a practical reactor must contain
materials other than fuel and these other materials absorb part of the
available neutrons. Furthermore, a certain fraction of the neutrons will
escape from the reactor without reactinhg. Therefore, the primary problem
of reactor theory is the specification of materials and an arrangement
which will conserve neutrons and result in a self-sustaining chain reaction.
Such an assembly is a reactor.

The chances that a neutron will escape from a reactor decrease as

the reactor is made larger, of course. The leakage probability is also
i)

reduced as the macroscopic cross section of the materials is increased.
Thus a self-sustaining chain reaction is possible in a small reactor if the
macroscopic cross section is adequately large. This requires either a

high concentration of fuel or a large microscopic cross section. Because

fission and absorption cross sections are much larger for slow neutrons
than for fast, most reactors utilize slow neutrons.* This is done by
ineluding in the reactor a substance, having a low atomic weight, a large
scattering cross section, and a small absorption cross section. This mate-
rial, called the moderator, slows down (moderates) the fast neutrons by
elastic scattering. It also helps to conserve neutrons by diverting those
that are headed out of the reactor. (Sometimes material with a hggh
scattering cross section is added around the outside of a reactor for the
sole purpose of scattering back or "reflecting" neutrons which would
otherwise escape. This is then called a reflector.)

In order to see how the requirements for a self-sustaining chain
reaction can be calculated, let us consider the various fates which may
befall a neutron in a reactor which contains fuel, moderator and other
neutron-absorbing material. There are several things that can happen and
they all affect the chance that one of the neutrons emitted in a fission
will survive to cause another fission. First, we will examine how the
individual probabilities of the different events combine to give the
overall probability of a fission neutron causing another fission. Then
we will see how the probabilities are determimed by the materials and
geometry of the reactor.

For simplicity, first consider the case of a reactor which we imagine
is so large that leaRage can be neglected. (Infinite reactor case.)
Suppose we begin with a large number, say x,'neutrons which have just been

235

born in U fissions caused by slow neutrons. (Refer to Fig. 24-6)

Some of these very fast neutrons will collide with uranium nuclei (either
235 238
U or U =)

the total number of fast neutrons will be increased by a factor, €, called

and result in fissions which produce more neutrons. Thus

%
Most reactorssutilize "thermal"” neutrons, i.e., neutrons which have been

slowed down until they reach an energy range fixed by the temperature of

the medium.

the fast fission factor. Now if neutrons which have suffered a few col-~

238

lisions so their energy is in the intermediate range pass near a U
nucleus, the chances are they will be swallowed up in radiative capture.*
The probability that neutrons will be slowed down past the resonance energy
without being absorbed is called the resonance escape probability, p

After the neutrons have been slowed down to thermal energies, only a
fraction are absorbed in U235. This fraction is the thermal utilization
factor, £ . (In an infinite reactor the remainder of the neutrons are

U235 are radiative

absorbed in other materials.) Some of the abéorptions in
capture, while others result in fission with a production of v neutrons per
fission. Thus one cycle is completed. The ratio of the neutrons present
after one cycle, or generation, to those present initially is called the
infinite multiplication factor or reproduction factor. (It is called
infinite because it applies only to a very large reactor where leakage

is negligible.)

The average number of fission neutrons produced per neutron absorbed
in U°3 is called eta (1), and for the absorption of thermal neutrons it
has a value of 2.08. The fast fission factor is a function of the ratio
of moderator to fuel, approaching unity for large values of the ratio.

The resonance escape probability also is a function of moderator-to-fuel
ratio, increasing to unity as the ratio increases. The thermal utilization
factor, in a homogeneous reactor, is just the ratio of the macroscopic
absorption cross section of the fuel to the total cross section of all the
components in the reactor. Even though only a very small fraction of

235

, the thermal utilization factor 1is usually

235

the atoms in a reactor are U
greater than 0.8 because the cross section of U is so high compared
with the other nuclides in the core. (Typical values are 690 barns for
U235; less than 0.01 barn for Be, C, or F.) Because in a heterogeneous
reactor the fuel, moderator and structure are not exposed to exactly the
same flux of neutrons, €, p, and f are all dependent on the size and

spacing of the fuel and moderator regions.

* 238
F'or neutrons of intermediate energy, U 3 has a very high cross section for

radiative capture. This 1s referred to as the resonance energy range.

Because a significant fraction of £he_neutrons escape from even large
reactors, the neutron leakage probabilities must be considered in calcula-
ting the multiplication factor which can actually be attained.

Iet us suppose that l-pl, is the probability that a fast neutron will
leak out of the reactor before it is slowed down or absorbed. Then Pl
is the fast non-leakage probability. There is a probability that a neutron
can escape from the reactor after it has become thermalized, and a slow

non-leakage probability, PQ’ can be defined. With the Inclusion of leakage

8 CRITICALITY

In the preceding sections we followed a group of neutrons through one

cycle, or generation, and derived a quantity, k, which is the ratio of
neutron production in successive generations. It 1s clear that if X = 1,
the fission chain reaction is self-sustaining and the neutron population,
the flux, the fission rate, and all reaction rates will be stationary in
time, without any contribution from neutron sources other than fission. The
critical condition is defined as that in which k = 1. Note that criticality
does not imply any particular power level, merely that the chain reaction

is exactly self-sgtstalning.

9 EXTRANEOUS NEUTRON SOURCES AND SUBCRITICAL MULTTIPLICATTION

Besides the fission process, several other nuclear reactions lead to

the emission of meutrons. Most important :of these are the interattion

of high-energy gamma rays or alpha particles with any of several materials,

the most important of which is Be9.
A»neutron source may be constructed using gamma rays from some fission

product, a neutron-activated material, or the natural radiocactive element,

radium. This is called'a photoneutron source, and the most common form

contains antimony-124 (60-day half-life, produced by neutron irradiation of
Approved by¢5§ﬂ224}§3//¢£ﬂy\ 2A~-20

T/21/65

123) and beryllium. An alpha-n source may contain a mixture of beryllium

Sb
with 138-day polonium-210 or long-lived radium or plutonium, all of which
emit alpha particles in their decay.

The MSRE fuel salt contains an inherent neutron source resulting from
interaction of alphas from uranium decay with the beryllium of the salt.

In addition, after fission products have built up in the reactor, a strong
photoneutron source will result from the fission product decay gammas
interacting with the beryllium.

The importance of these extraneous sources of neutrons is that they can
be used to maintain some neutron population or fission rate in a reactor
even when the fission chain reaction is not self-sustaining.

Consider a reactor which is subcritical, i.e., k < 1. On the average,
each fast neutron introduced by an extraneous source will produée in the
first generation k neutrons; in the second Ke; and so on. Thus for each

source neutron, there eventually appear a number of neutrons M given by

. 2 .3 B 1
M=21+k+k +k” +eeee =

If source neutrons are being introduced at a rate S, then the total rate

of neutron appearance in the reactor is SM. The population of neutrons in
the reactor is the product of the birth rate and the average time a neutron
spends in the reactor before being absorbed or leaking out. If the lifetime
is a constant in a reactor with an extraneous source, the population and
the flux will be proportidénzl”. to M. For this reason M is called thé
subcritical multiplication factor.

M becomes very large as k approaches a value of 1. Thus, theoretically,
if a source is present, any flux or power could be reached with the reactor
slightly subcritical. Practically speaking, however, the source becomes
insignificant when the power reaches a few watts or so, and the reactor
behaves as if no source were present; i.e., the power rises when the reactor
is supercritical (k > 1) and decreases when it is suberitical,

10  REACTOR KINETICS

Consider a hypothetical reactor in which all of the neutrons have the

same generation time, #. Neglecting any extraneous source, the fractional
change in flux, or power in one generation is k - 1. Thus the rate of change

of power is
Approved by4§???gy%?2é/ﬂQ¢nL 2A~21

T/21/65

- Ap P (k- 1)
‘ At 2

In this case, if k is constant, the power changes exponentially; i.e.,

for an initial power Po’ the power after a time t is

pop ot (- D/

o}
The quantity £/(k - 1) is called the period, or the e-folding time since
it is the period required for an e-fold change in power. Somewhat more

ganerally, the period 1s defined as the instantaneous value of

dP 4 (In P)

B dt

H -
C'.

In an actual reactor the generation time is not the same for all
neutrons. The lifetime is about the same for all (typically less than a

millisecond) but the generation time includes the "gestation period" for

the delayed neutrons {(on the order of several seconds). The delayed neutrons
usually therefore exert a strong slowing down or damping influence on power
changes. Although the mathematical expressions for the kinetics become
complicated when delayed neutrons are included, the behavior is still
basically exponential and an important characteristic of a reactor is the
"inhour curve" which relates the inverse period to the reactivity.
(Reactivity is defined as (k - 1)/k.)

The inverse‘period increases with reactivity and this increase becomes
much sharper above the point where the reactivity equals B, the fraction of
the neutrons which are delayed. This point is called prompt critical
because at higher reactivity, the chain reaction can diverge with prompt
neutrons alone, without waiting for the delayed neutrons. At a constant k -

above prompt critical the power behavior is approximately given by

*
where £ 18 here the prompt neutron lifetime. The reactivity is sometimes

measured in "dollars", or multiples of . (One dollar is promptycritical.)

e
Approved bx4¢§f%2V%%6;V/wfw 2A-22
7/21/65

In the normal operation of a reactor the reactivity is adjusted (by
means to be described later) to hold to power steady or to go from one

power level to another at a reasonable rate.

11  NUCLEAR TINSTRUMENTATTION

The most satisfactory means of continuously monitoring the nuclear
power of a reactor is to follow the neutron flux at some point. The
detector can be located outside of the reactor itself, because the flux
produced by neutrons leaking from the reactor rises and falls with the
power inside.

The most common form of neutron detector is the ionization chamber.

In such a device, neutrons interact with some material to produce high-
speed particles which ionize (strip electrons from atoms) in a gas in the
chamber. An electric potential causes the electrons and positive ions to
be drawn to opposite electrodes, and appropriate circuitry either counts
the pulses of ions or measures the average current.

Boron-10, which emits an ionizing alpha particle upon absorption
of a neutron, is commonly used in ion chambers, either as a coating or in
the form of BF3 gas. A form of ion chamber called a fission chamber
contains U235, and the fission fragments produce the ionization.

Gamma, radiation interferes with the measurement of low fluxes of
neutrons, because the gamma rays also produce ionization and contribute to
the current in a neutron-sensitive chamber. This 1s no problem in a
fission chamber because the counting circuit can be made to discriminate
between the large pulses caused by fission fragments and the much smaller
events caused by individual gamma photons. The compensated ion chamber
was developed to provide a current proportional only to neutron flux even
in high gamma fields. This type of detector has two chambers which produce
equal ionization currents when exposed only to gamma rays. One of the
chambers contains & boron coating so that 1t is sensitive to neutrons as
well as to gammas. The desired signal is obtained by bucking or subtracting
the currents from the two parts of the detector.

Because the reactor power may vary over many decades from sub-critical
source multiplication to full power and because the time variation is often
exponential, it is common to use circuitry to produce a signal proportional

to the logarithm of the power. This may be a log count rate meter or &
..

T/21/65
logarithmic current amplifier. 1In either case the time derivative is the
inverse of the period, and, displayed on properly marked dials or charts,
provides a useful indication of the period.

Note that the nuclear instruments give a signal which is only pro-

portional to power. The proportionality factor muist generally be determined

by heat balance measurements and simultaneous nuclear instrument readings.

12  REACTOR CONTROL

The function of reactor control is to regulate the power and/or
temperature in the desired ranges, to prevent excessive power or temperature,
and to shut the fission chain reaction down to very low levels whenever
necessary. To do this, the reactivity is varied, usually bj the movement
of neutron absoroing material (generally called a rod, regardiess of
shape) into and out of the core.

Small, fairly quick, variations in reactivity (less than a dollar)
are required to maintain the power within a narrow band. This is the regula-
ting function and a special rod for thié is called a regulating rcd.

Rods which can rapidly insert considerable poison if required to
prevent power or temperature excursions are called safety rods.

There are several factors affecting reactivity which produce rather
s10W changes during an operating cycle (startﬁp, power operation and shut-
down). At some stages the net effect is a tendency to reduce k; at other
times, k tends to increase. In order to keep k at or near 1, control
rods may be occasionally or gradually adjusted. Rods performing this
function are called shim rods.

An important effect on reactivity is that of core temperatures. As
temperatures rise, materials grow less dense and microscopic ciross sections
change. The net effect is usually a negative temperaturs coefficient of
reactivity, so that the reactivity must be increased by some other means
if the operating temperature is to be raised. Distinet from shifts in the
overall temperature distribution are the changes in temperature distribution
accompanying power changes. As the power is raised, temperatures in various
parts of the core diverge, and in order to hold some desired temperature
(or temperature average) constant it is generally necessary to adjust the
reactivity by shim rod movement. The power coefficient of reactivity is the

amount of rod motion required to produce tThe desired effect.
7Y ft
Approved byizg;ﬂzégk%z»zﬁw\_ 2A-2L
v 7/21/65

Temperature coefficients of reactivity not only affect shim require-
ments but also have an important effect on kinetics, since negative reactivity
coefficients tend to produce a stable, self-regulating system when the
power is high enough to produce a feédback effect.

235

During power operation, consumption of U by fission and by radiative

capture tends to reduce reactivity. This burnup effect is slow, since

only a very small fraction of the inventory is consumed in a day. Shim

rod movement and periodic additions of uranium compensate for this effect.
Another effect of power operaticn is the produétion of fission product

poisons which tend to reduce k. Most of these poisons are stable and have

relatively small cposs sections, so they continue to build up. Shim rods

compensate for these poisons. (In the MSRE the U235 inventory is increased.)

A few poisons with high cross sections produce transient effects, with time

constants on the order of hours, and these effects require the use of the

shim rods.

In & circulating-fuel reactor one more effect on reactivity is observed: -

the loss of delayed neutrons by emission outside of the core. This causes
a slight reduction in k (the effective value of v is reduced) but more

importantly it affects the kinetics (the value of the "dollar" is reduced).

13 XENON AND SAMARTUM

radioactive nuclide (9-hour half life) has a thermal neutron cross seciion

of about 3 million barns. Most Xe

135 is about 2 to 3% in k. When the

cause the destruction by neutron capture decreases before the production
by I135 decay changes appreciably. Radioactive decay of the X8135 causes
the concentration to begin to decrease after a few hours and eventually

it would all disappear.

Xenon is normally a gas, and in fluid-fuel reactors the Xe concen-

2B MSRE NUCLEAR CHARACTERISTICS

The preceding general description of reactor theory is applicable to
the MSRE, as it is to all reactors. This section describes the uvnusual
features of the MSRE and provides gquantitative information on its nuclear
characteristics in a condensed form. A much more detailed treatment is
given in MSRE Design and Operations Report — Part III, Nuclear Analysis,
ORNL TM-730.

1. Core Reactivity Factors

The uvnique feature of the MSRE, which sets it apart from other
reactors, is that the uranium fuel is contained in a molten mixture of
fluoride salts which is circulated through a heat exchanger to remove
the heat produced by the fission process in the core.

Although the fissionable material is dispersed throughout the fuel
system, the fission chain reaction is confined to the core. The fuel 1is
not chain-reacting in the piping because the neutron leakage prcbability
is much too high because of the small dimensions. In the heat exchanger,
the parasitic absorption of neutroné by the tubes combines with high
leakage to rule out criticality. Even in the drain tanks, the leakage
is too high for criticality. (Resonance capture in 2387 and absorption
in the cooling thimbles also tend to reduce k.) The high leakage and
resonance absorption are direct consequences of the poor moderation in
the salt. In the core, on the other hand, there is graphite to slow
the neutrons down with but little absorption, and with the slow neutrons
the vessel is large enough to give a low probability of leakage.

The reactivity of the core is a function of several variables.
These are:

.  the concentration of 33U in the fuel salt,
the temperatures of the fuel and the graphite,
the presence of gas bubbles in the core,

the positions of the neutron-absorbing control rods,

6. the number of neutrons emitted in the core per fission (as

affected by the loss of delayed neutrons during fuel circu-
lation). | | |
Each of these variables is discussed separately in this section.

1.1 Fuel Salt Concentration

The minimum amount of 35U required for criticality in the MSRE is
about 50 kg (in 73 ft? of salt) or a concentration in the fuel salt of
0.2 mole % of highly enriched uranium. For the first exploratory opera-
tion of the MSRE, a higher uranium concentration is desired for reasons
of chemistry. (If fluorine loss from the salt should occur, more UF,
could go to UFs before U precipiﬁatibn would occur.) Therefore in the
original charge of fuel salt the uranium concentration will first be
brought up to 0.5 mole % by the addiﬁion of 150 kg of depleted uranium.
(The #35U fraction of this uranium is only 0.002.) Then, during the
initial critical experiment, the 233U concentration will be brought up
by addition of highly enriched uranium (93% 225U) to the "clean critical”
concentration. This is the concentration required for criticality with
no fission product poisons in the reactor, all control rods fully with-
drawn, the fuel salt stationary, and the reactor at a uniform temperature
of 1200°F. The predicted critical loading is 69 kg of 235U, giving a
total uranium concentration in the salt of 0.80 mole % U. This salt is
sometimes referred to as fuel C, having a molar composition of 65 LiF-29.2
BeF>-5.0 Z2rF,~0.8 UF,. The values quoted later in this section for
nuclear parameters apply when the reactor is fueled with this salt.

Addition of highly enriched uranium when the concentration 1s near
the critical value causes an increase of 0.22% 8k/k for each percent
increase in 235U concentration. Thus the addition of 85 g 25U (the
amount in an enriching capsule) would produce an increase of only
0.03% dk/k.

After the initial critical loading, about 7 kg of 25U will be
added as highly enriched uranium to bring the fuel salt up to the opera-
ting concentration (0.28 mole % 35U, 0.83 mole % total U). The increase
is required to compensate for effects which will appear when the reactor

is operated at high power, namely:

Burnup — When the reactor is operated at power, 35U is consumed by
fission and by radiative capture} (The ratio of captures to fissions is
0.18.) The rate amounts to 1.25 g/Mwd, which means that the amount
which can be added in one capsule would be consumed in about 7 days at
10 Mw. When the reactor is operated at full power, additions of enriched
uranium will be mede at intervals of 7 days or less so that not only is
the loss due to burnup made up but the 235y inventory is actually in-
creased to compensafe for the negative reactivity effects of fission pro-
ducts which are building up.

Non-uniform Uranium Distributions ~ The coefficient of reactivity

for changes in 235U concentration which was quoted above applies to uni-
form inecreases in the concentration. Although no significant non-uniformi-
ties in uranium concentration are anticipated in operation, the reactivity
effects of localized uranium are worth noting. The reactivity effect of

a given amount of 235U could be much greater if it were all in the core
than if it were evenly dispersed throughout the 75 cu ft of fuel salt.
Uranium evenly distributed in the core is worth 3 times as much as the
average over the entire loop. A small amount of uranium at the point of
maximum importance (near the center of the core) would be worth 15 times
as much as the loop average.

1.2 Temperature and Power

Changes in fuel temperature and in graphite temperature affect
reactivity in different ways. The primary effect of graphite temperature
is through its influence on the thermal neutron velocity distribution;
an increase in temperature resulting in higher energies and lower cross
sections. The reactivity is affected by fuel salt temperature mainly

because thermal expansion of the salt reduces the amount of 25U in the
L f
Approved by -‘f;',f<t€}4#/ﬁ4\ 2B-4
, 10/19/65

core. Other, less important effects are the decrease in moderation by
Li, Be and I as the salt expands and the influence of salt temperature
on thermal neutron energies.

I1f the temperature of the fuel and graphite is uniform throughout
the core, an increase in the overall temperature would produce a decrease
in reactivity; the ratio is the temperature coefficient of reactivity,
~7.0 X 1075 °F"%, (To illustrate, a 10°F increase over the entire core
would cause the reactivity to decrease by 0.07% 8k/k.)

If a uniform change could be produced throughout the fuel in the
core without changing the graphite temperature, the reactivity effect
would be -3.3 X 1075 °F™L, A uniform change in graphite temperature
alone would give -3.7 X 10°® °F 2. The sum of the fuel coefficient and
the graphite coefficient is the total coefficient, -7.0 X 1075 “F71,

When the reactor is operated at power, temperature distributions
are established in which the rate of fuel temperature increase as the
salt rises along a channel is proportional to the heat generation at
the point. The graphite temperature at any point is above that of the
fuel by an amount proportional to the local heat generation. (See later
section on fluxes, heat generation and temperatures.) As the power is
raised and the temperatures depart from isothermal, the net reactivity
effects of the change in fuel temperature can be regarded as the product
of the fuel temperature coefficient of reactivity and the change in an
average temperature which appropriately reflects the reactivity effect
of the actual distribution of fuel temperatures. This is called the
nuclear average temperature of the fuel (NAT). An NAT can be similarly
defined for the graphite: Calculations indicate the fuel and graphite
NATs (T% and T*) are related to the fuel temperatures entering and

leavingfthe refctor vessel as follows:

The shapes of the temperature distributions at power are charac-
teristics of the physical system. On the other hand, the entire
temperature distribution can be shifted up or down simply by moving the
control rods to obtain any desired relation of the temperatures at power
to the isothermal temperature before the power was raised. (When the
rods are moved the entire temperature distribution must shift to produce
a compensating effect to keep the reactor just critical.) The amount
of reactivity change which must be produced with the rods to'obtain the
desired temperature response is called the power coefficient of reac-
tivity. The MSRE rod servo system holds the reactor outlet temperature
constant. The power coefficient for this mode of operation is
-6 x 107° Mw~ L,
1.3 Control Rod Positions

When the control rods are inserted in the core, they absorb neutrons
which might otherwise cause fission, thereby reducing keff' Except when

the nuclear power 1is shut down to practically zero, k is always kept

e
in the range 1.000 *+ 0.001. This is done by adjustingfihe rods as
regquired to compensate for other changes which tend to take k out of
that range.

The change in reactivity per unit distance of rod movement is the
sensitivity. The upper end of the poison section‘extends out the top
of the core at all times, so the movement of a rod is equivalent to
adding or removing a length of poison from the core at the lower end
of the rod. The reactivity effect of adding poison in the core depends
on where it is added, being approximately proportional to the square of
the ratio of the local neutron flux to the average flux. The flux
distribution from top to bottom of the core is approximately a sine
curve. Thus the sensitivity of a control rod varies with the position
of its lower end approximately as (sin ny/L)Z, where L is the effective
length of the core and y is the distance from the top of the "effective
core"” to the lower end of the poison. The effective limits of the core

are where the flux distributions in the core extrapolate to zero.

The poisoning effect of a rod at any given position is the integral

which is an s-shaped curve as shown in Fig. 2B-1. This expression is

in its vicinity so that the sensitivity does not follow exactly a sin®

curve. The relation of the actual worth curve to the simple approxi-
mation is shown in Fig. 2B-1.

rod travel is only 51 in. between limit switches, the available worth .
of a rod is only 0.927 of the total. Application of this factor to
the total predicted worth of rod 1 gives an available worth of 2.2%
Ne/k. The first evaluation of the worth of rod 1 gave 2.18%.
Because of the core symmetry, rods 1 and 3 are identical in worth;
rod 2 is somewhat less than either because it is more "shadowed" by the
other rod thimbles or rods. The worths listed in this table were pre-
dicted for the initial, clean core. When fission product poisons build
up and more #3°U is added to the fuel, the neutron diffusion length in .
the core is reduced, making the rods worth less. This effect is ex-
pected to reduce the figures in Table 2B-1 by about 6 percent. A
Any rod can be designated as the regulating rod (rod 1 on the con-
sole) by wiring it in to the servo system which controls flux or reactor
outlet temperature. The other two rods are the shim rods. Because it
is an advantage to be able to shift the regulating function from one
rod to another without changing either the regulating rod worth or the
shim worth, Rod 1 will be designated as regulating rod initially and
if a change is necessary, Rod 3 will become the regulating rod.
The effect of flux depression or "shadowing" which shows in Fig.
2B-1 and Table 2B-1 also causes the sensitivity of a rod to change sharply .
as i1ts end moves by that of another rod. (Picture a rod moving up into
or down out of the "shadow" around another rod.) For this reason the
two rods used as shims are kept well above the regulating rod, so that
its sensitivity does not change sharply. One reason for this is that "
the reactivity balance calculation uses approximations for rod worth
which fit better when the rod tips are not too close. (See MSR-64-1k,
"On-Line Computation of Control Rod Effect for Reactivity Balance.")
1.4 Xenon-135
In the MSRE, 135%e is produced at a rate of 6.3 atoms per 100

fissions. About 97 percent appears first as +3°I vwhich decays with a
6.7-hr half-life to *>°Xe. The other 3 percent is formed directly in
fission. ZIodine-135 is uniformly distributed throughout the fuel salt,
giving a distributed source of 135%e. (Any uranium in the graphite

gives rise to a localized source of iodine and xenon, but this is

LY

relatively unimportant.) Xenon-135 which appears in the circulating
fuel salt may (1) decay to long-lived *3°Cs (2) capture a neutron and
go to stable 13%Xe, (3) be transferred to the gas in the pump bowl or
(k) be transferred into the gas-filled pores in the core graphite.
Xenon-135 in the graphite may decay, be burned up by neutron capture
or move back into the salt.

The time constants for the decay and burnup are well known. The
half-life of *35Xe for natural decay is 9.2 hrs., giving a decay con-
stant of 0.075 hr *. The effective cross section (in the MSRE neutron
energy spectrum) is 1.5 x 10° barns, giving a burnup time constant for
13°Xe dispersed around the fuel system of 0.02 hr '. For *35Xe evenly
distributed throughout the graphite in the core, the burnup time constant
would be 0.07 hr *. (These burnup time constants are at 10 Mw and are
proportional to reactor power.) The rate constants for the other
processes are not well known, and an important objective of the MSRE
operation is to determine values for them. It is expected that the
transfer to the pump bowl offgas will be relatively fast, resulting in
low steady-state xenon-poisoning {only 0.1% Ek/k or less at 10 Mw).
1.5 Other Fission Products

If 135Xe poisoning is kept low by gas stripping as expected, the

individual fission product contributing most to the neutron poisoning
in the MSRE will be *4®sm. The steady state poisoning of 149y in the
MSRE at any significant power will be about 0.9% 8k/k. (The steady-
state level is independent of power because both the burnup time con-
stant, ¢o, and the production rate are proportional to power, and the
steady-state level is the ratio.) The initial ingrowth of 149gm will
be slow, s0 the reactor must be operated at high power for several
months before the 14%gm reaches steady state.

The transients in +4®sm poisoning have a much shorter time constant,
namely that of the decay of 53-h 14%pm, the precursor of *%%m. When
the power is shut down, the destruction of 14%Sm stops and the 148py
which is present scon decays into l498m, increasing its poisoning effect
on reactivity. The steady-state amount of 4®pp is proportional to
power, and hence so is the size of the 149y poisoning transient following

a shutdown. When the power is shut down from 10 Mw, the 149gm transient
Approved by% > adiaN 2B=10
T S—

10/19/65

will be about 0.03% 8k/k.
There are a few other high-cross-section fission products which
saturate in roughly the same length of time as 149Sm, and some exhibit
similar transients. The combined effect of these will be about 0.2
that of +4°gm.
The large majority of fission products (all those except 136Xe and
the "Samarium" group) contribute to a poisoning effect which will grow
approximately linearly with integrated power in the MSRE. The rate will v
be about 1 x 10 4% 8k/k per Mw-day.
1.6 Delayed Neutrons

When the fuel salt is stationary all of the delayed neutron pre-
cursors decay in the core. When the fuel is circulating, part of the
precursors decay outside of the core and these delayed neutrons are lost
to the chain reaction.

The delayed neutrons comprise 0.0064 of the total neutrons released
by fission. Because their initial energies are lower than the average
for all fission neutrons, the delayed neutrons are less apt to leak

during slowing down, and the effective fraction of delayed neutrons in

the non-circulating case is 0.0067. When the fuel is circulating, the
delayed neutrons emitted in the main part of the core are 0.0039 of
the total. DBut because many of the delayed neutrons are now emitted
in the reactor-vessel heads, from which some reach the core, the effective
fraction is 0.0046. Thus circulation causes an effective loss of 0.0021
of the neutrons, or a decrease in reactivity of 0.21% Sk/k. .
The changes in reactivity assoclated with the delayed neutron pre-
cursor transport reach steady state within a minute or two after circu-
lation is stopped or started. When the pump is stoppéd, the reactivity
increagses as precursors are no longer swept out of the core. Time
constants are those associated with coastdown of the flow and the half-
lives for precursor decay which govern the concentration transients.
When fuel circulation is first started, the concentrations of precursors
will immediately drop below the steady-state values as salt with practi-
cally no precursors flows into the core. There will be some small per-

turbations as the salt which was in the core comes back, but this effect

-
‘r’

L 'fljgiﬂfij;«“ : _

rd </ 10/19/65
is smeared out by mixing. Of course when circulation is first started
the reactivity changes are unimportant because the reactor is well
subcritical. (The rods are inserted before the fuel pump is started.)
1.7 BEntrained Gas in Fuel

Development testing of the prototype of the fuel circulating pump
indicated that undissolved helium bubbles to the extent of 0.5-1% by
colume could be expected to circulate with the fuel salt. These bubbles
were introduced by the action of the spray ring in the pump bowl.
Operation at the MSRE has showed that essentially no bubbles circulate
with the salt if the level in the pump bowl is at the normal operating
point or higher (>60%). However a bubble fraction of 2-3% was observed
at an abnormally low salt level.

When gas bubbles appear in the fuel salt in the core, the density
of the salt-gas mixture decreases, the neutron diffusion length increases
and as a result, reactivity decreases. The fuel density coefficient of
reactivity was calculated to be 0.18. Thus, a bubble fraction of 1%
would result in a reactivity decrease of 0.18% ak/k. The presence of
bubbles causes the fuel density, and hence the reactivity to respond
to pressure changes. With ~ 2 1/2% bubbles, the pressure coefficient
of reactivity was 3 x 10°° 6k/k per psi for slow pressure changes and
1.4 x 107% for rapid changes.

Since the MSRE will normally operate with no bubbles circulating,
the effects described above will not be observable. However, they may
appear under abnormal circumstances (low pump-bowl level).

2. Heat Generation and Temperature Distributions

About 93% of the heat associated with the fisgsion process in the
MSRE is produced within the fuel by fission fragments and the various
radiation scattering and capture processes. About 6.5% is generated
in the graphite and transferred to the fuel in the core. This leaves
only about 0.5% to be absorbed in the thermal shield, biological shield,
and structural material in the cells. (About 5% of the energy of
fission escapes in the form of neutrinos and never produces any heat;

this energy is not included in the above balance.)
Approved byﬁ%ﬂ{ % 2B-12

2.] Overall Temperature. Distribution’

The overall temperature distribution in the fuel is determined by

the spatial distribution of the power and the flow rate of the salt.

At 10 Mw the nominal temperature rise of the fuel from reactor inlet

to outlet is SOOF. Since about 14% of the power is generated in the
upper and lower heads and other peripheral regions of the reactor vessel,
the average temperature rise as the fuel passes through the graphite
channels is only 430F. The fuel undergoes a 3.5O#temperature rise before
it reaches the graphite and anothexr 3.50 rise between the time it leaves
the graphite and the time it leaves the core. The temperaturesin the
upper and lower heads are expected to‘be more-or-less uniform because

of fluid mixing.

Since most of the heat of fission comes from the fission fragments,
the heat-source distribution is essentially the same as the fission
distribution which,in turn, has about the same shape as the thermal-
neutron flux. The fuel velocity is relatively unifrom over most of the
core, with a region of high velocity near the center. §Since the neutron
flux is depressed near the center of the core by the control rods and
thimbles, the temperature rise of the fuel in the central channels is
much lower than that in channels some distance out from the center.

The maximum temperature rise (~ 86°F) occurs in the channels about 8

in. from the core center line. The temperature of fuel in any channel
increases continuously from the inlet to the outlet. The rate of
increase is proportional to the heat production, or flux; low at the .
ends and high in the middle. Since the shape of the power distribution

along a channel follows approximately a sine curve, the axial temper-

ature distribution of the fuel (proportional to the integral of the

flux distribution) has the shape of the general curve (L - cos x).

The temperature of the graphite at any point in the core is higher
than that of the adjacent fuel because the heat produced in the graphite
must flow into the fuel. The maximum difference between the mean trans-
verse temperature in a graphite stringer and the mean transverse tem-

perature in a fuel channel is 61°F near the midplane of the core. Because

of the continuously rising fuel temperature, the absolute maximum graphite -

-
A

ey ary
Approved bx/¢%§;::? ‘W&ézg/kiﬁbL 2B-13
T a4 . 10/19/65

temperature (~ l3OOOF) occurs considerably above the core midplane.
2.2 Local Temperature Effects
Local overheating is not likely in the MSRE because of the rela-

tively low power density. However, there are some areas in the reactor
vessel where local heating must be considered.

The INOR-8 structural parts of the reactor are subject to radiation
heating by gamma rays and fast neutrons. For the most part, this heat
1s efficiently removed by the salt flowing past the surfaces. However,
if solids were deposited from the salt, they could inhibit such heat
removal (and produce more heat if the deposits contain 23%U) and lead
to locally high temperatures. The reactor-vessel lower head and the
core-suppert ring above the inlet voiute are areas where solids couid
accumulate if they form in the fuel salt. The temperatures in these
areas are continuously monitored for evidence of local overheating.

The control-rod thimbles are subject to substantial radiation
heating because of their location near the center of the core. Under
normal conditions they are adequately cooled by the combination of
salt on the outside and rod-cooling alr on the inside.

Blockage of a fuel channel would require that the heat produced
in that channel be transferred through the graphite stringers to the
fuel in adjacent channels. The temperatures resulting from this con-
dition would not damage the reactor.

3. Instrumentation

The nuclear instrumentation is described in detail in the MSRE
Design and Operations Report - Part IT, Nuclear and Process Instru-
mentation, ORNL - TM - 729. A brief summary is given here of the
operating principles and functions of those instruments which respond
to neutrons or the nuclear power of the reactor. |

3.1 Non-fission Neutron Sources

Neutrons are of course produced by the fission process at a rate
proportional to the power-level. But neutrons are also produced in
the reactor by other processes. The strength of this fission-independent
neutron source is related to safety. It is also closely related to the

neutron instruments because whenever the fission rate is very low, it
Approved byws,;ﬁw' i 229ﬂl¢4h4 2B-14

” -~ ~ | 10/19/65

provides most of the neutrons that are counted by the detectors. Thus
the selection of the source and detectors must be ‘'coordinated to provide
the necessary information for reactor opei"ation°

The prime safety function of a neutron source is to guarantee a
sufficiently high neutron population so the statistical nature of the
neutronic processes is maintained. In addition the source supports a
certain minimum fission rate, or power level, in the suberitical reactor.
Since the size of the power excursion for a given reactivity ramp .
generally increases as the initial power decreases, this minimum level
tends to limit the severity of some accidents. Another useful, but not
safety, function of an independent neutron source is that it permits
monitoring the subcritical multiplication in the reactor as criticality
is approached. This is particularly important in the MSRE where keff
in the empty reactor starts at zero and each fill with fuel salt is
essentailly a new critical experiment.

Three types of non-fission neutron sources are important in the
MSRE: 1) the inherent alpha-n source in the fuel salt, 2) the external
(Am-Cm-Be) source in the thermal-shield source tube, and 3) the photo-
neutron (r,n) source which results from the interaction of fission
product gammas with beryllium.

3.1.1 Inherent Source

The alpha particles emitted by the various uranium isotopes
in the fuel interact with the Li, Be, and F to produce neutrons.
The alpha particles from 234U acting on Be and F produce about 96%
of these neutrons. With the reactor full of fuel salt at the nor-
mal operating concentration, the internal source releases about :
b x 10° n/sec in the core. This source is adequate for all the
safety requirements of the system. However, since the source is
absent when the reactor is empty, it does not meet the requirement
for monitoring suberitical multiplication during a fill.
3.1.2 External Source

Neutrons are produced in this source by the action of alpha

particles from 24%am and 242Cm on ®Be. The source was produced

by mixing 0.6g of 24lAm with Be and irradiating the mixture in the

Ve
R d

; a%?pf
Approved by .~ Lo L2 2B-15
Cdl ..v g

10/19/65

ORR to transmute some of the Am to 24Cm. When fresh, this source
emitted sbout 1.2 x 10®8 n/sec but, since it is installed in the
thermal shield, only a fraction (<25%) of these neutrons actually
enter the core. More than 99% of the external-source neutrons come
from the Cm alphas so the effective half-life of the source is that
of 242Cm, 160 days. Thus the intensity of the external source will
decrease with time unless the neutron flux from the operating reactor
is high enough to keep the Cm concentration high.

Since the external source i1s independent of the fuel location,
these neutrons and their progeny are counted when the reactor is
empty and during the initial stages of a fill when the internal
source is insignificant.

3.1.3 Photoneutron Source

Gamma rays with energies greater than 1.7 Mev are capable of
producing neutrons from ®Be. Since a number of 35U fission pro-
ducts emit gammas with energies above this threshold, the MSRE
will have a substantial internal photoneutron source after an
inventory of fission products has been established. This mechanism
will provide at least 107 n/sec in the core for 100 days after the
reactor has operated at 10 Mw for 30 days. The photoneutron source
is subject to decay and is not very effective after long shutdowns.
Furthermore, it has the same disadvantage as the (o,n) source - it
is observable only when the fuel is in the reactor.

3.2 Neutron Detectors

Radiation d.etectors in general consist of a chamber filled with
an ionizable gas and devices for collecting the ionic charges. When a
particle of ionizing radiation passes through the gas, positive ions and
electrons are formed which flow to oppositely charged electrodes producing
a small electric current. These small pulses of current can be amplified
and registered as discrete events or can be "smeared out" and measured
as an average current.

Since neutrons are uncharged, they do not produce any direct ion-
ization in passing through matter. Thus, neutrons as such cannot be

detected by ionization chambers. To circumvent this, neutron chambers
=y
Approved}ﬁﬁi;;}izz£2£ZEﬁ¢hm\§_ 2B-16
” ~

10/19/65

contain a material that will interact with neutrons and produce ionizing
radiation. This secondary radiation then produces ionization in the
chamber which is detected and registered as a neutron event.

The neutron detectors in the MSRE are located in the nuclear instru-
ment shaft some distance from the reactor core. However, the neutrons
that leak out of the operating reactor produce a significant neutron flux
in and around the various detectors. ©Since the shape of the neutron flux
in the core of the critical reactor is essentially independent of power
level, a nearly constant fraction of all the neutrons produced by fissions
in the reactor escapes. The fraction of escaped (leakage) neutrons that
reaches a given location in the instrument shaft is also independent of
the neutron population density. Thus, a neutron detector with a fixed
detection efficiency at a fixed location will register neutron events
at a rate that is directly proportional to the neutron level (or fission
rate, or power level) in the reactor. The conversion factor between
neutron-chamber output and reactor power can be established only if the
absolute reactor power can be measured by an independent method. The
method that is used to measure absolute reactor power is a system heat
balance. Thus, once accurate heat balances have been obtained, it will
be possible to read absolute power directly from the nuclear instruments.

Four types of neutron detectors are in use in the MSRE. These are
fission chambers, BFs pulse counters, compensated ion chambers, and
boron-coated safety chambers. The basic features of each are described
below.

3.2.1 HFission Chambers

A fission chamber makes use of the very intense ionization
produced by fission fragments to register the passage of neutrons.
Some of the interior surfaces of the MSRE fission chambers are
coated with @35U (other fissionable materials may be used in other
applications) which undergoes fission in a neutron flux. Most of
the time at least one of the primary fission fragments escapes from
the surfaces and produces a very large pulse of ionization. These
pulses are amplified and counted as individual events. Alpha

particles from the radiocactive decay of the uranium in the chamber

e
o

S

and gamma rays from outside also produce ionization in a fission
chamber but the associated pulses are very much smaller than those
from fission fragments. Thus with an electronic circuit which counts
only the largest pulses, a fission chamber can be made to discrimia.
nate against nearly all radiation effects other than from neutrons.
The two fission chambers in use in the MSRE will produce a
counting rate of about 0.4 counts/sec in a neutron flux of 1 n/cm?—
sec. The normal useful range of a fission chamber is about k4
decades in counting rate. Below about 2 c/s the time response of
the count-rate circuitry is too slow to be very useful; above
about 20,000 c/s coincidence losses begin to be observable. The
useful range of the MSRE chambers has been greatly extended by
equipping them with servo-operated positioning devices. BSince the
neutron flux in the instrument shaft decreases approximately expo-
nentially with distance from the reactor, the logarithm of the
ratio of the flux at one point to that at some reference point
(say, the bottom of the shaft) is proportional to the distance
between the points. That is

toe [%g_z)} "o [X - XJ-

Or
log é(x,) = log &(x) + a(x - x5).

Thus, .%he log of the count rate or flux (and hence the actual count
rate) at some reference point, where it is too high to be measured
accurately, can be obtained from the log of the count rate at some
other point by adding to it a number proportional to thé distance
between the points. If the correlation between flux at the ref-
erence point and reactor power is known, this approach can be used
to indicate the log of the reactor power directly.

The above principle is used to extend the useful range of the
MSRE fission chambers to about 10 decades. The chamber travel to

accomplish this is about 90 in. This allows them to cover a power
Approved by/jgﬁéfz%izégﬁ:%/lzéﬂ@\ 2B-18
T ~ 10/19/65

range from well below critical (0.0lw) to well above full power

(100 Mw). Since the exponential decrease of flux with distance

is only approximate, electronic corrections are applied to improve

the correlation between log power and the sum of log count rate and

position. Even so, these instruments do not give the most precise

indication of nuclear power that is available.

3.2.2 BF4 Pulse Counters

A BF5 chamber is simply a vessel equipped to collect ionization

pulses and filled with boron trifluoride gas. This gas, in addition
to being ionizable, contains *°B which interacts with neutrons to
produce alpha particles. Since the ionization pulses from alphas
are large, this chamber can be made relatively insensitive to

gamma, radiation (but less so than a fission chamber). It also

has a high neutron-detection efficiency.

It was originally expected that the fission chambers described
above would have sufficient sensitivity to give significant counting
rates (>2¢/s) with the reactor vessel empty and only the external
source present. This was not achieved because of physical limjita-
tions on the source intensity and the unfavorable location of the
source with respect to the detectors. Therefore, detectors with
higher sensitivity were provided for this condition and to monitor
the early stages of a reactor fill. (The fission chambers provide
a useful indication before the reactor is completely filled with
fuel salt.) The chambers used in this application are two BFs
chambers with sensitivities of ih c/sec per unit neutron flux
(1 n/em®-sec). Because of their high sensitivity, these chambers
are subject to rapid depletion of the 108 in high neutron fluxes
and must be retracted to a low-flux region when the reactor is in
operation.

3.2.3 Compensated Ion Chambers

This type of device measures the average current produced by
ionizing radiation rather than discrete pulses. The neutron-
sensitive portion of a compensated ion chamber is a vessel, fitted

with charge-collecting electrodes, filled with an ionizable gas,

“‘
It

B
——

Approved pyﬁ£§?z y%gficyﬂhffix_ 2B-19

10/19/65

and coated on the inside with boron enriched in *°B. Since the

gas is ionized by gamma rays as well as by the alphas from the OB
(4,) 7Li reaction, the output of this subchamber is proportional

to the total radiation level. When a reactor is operating at

power, the contribution to the chamber current from gamma radiation
is relatively low and the output of the boron-coated chamber is
essentially proportional to the neutron flux (power level). However,
when the reactor is shut.down, .the neutron flux drops to a very low
level while the gamma radiation from the fission products remains
high. Thus, the indicated current is high relative to the actual

power level. In order to compensate for this high reading at low

power, a second subchamber is used that is sensitive to gamma rays
only; that is, no boron coating is used. If this second chamber
has the same characteristics (volume, gas pressure, collection
voltage, etc.) as the boron-coated chamber, the currents induced
in the two chambers by gamma radiation will be equal. The outputs
of these two chambers are connected with opposing polarities
(bucking each other) so that the two gamma-induced currents cancel
each other and the net current flow is due to neutron-induced ion-

ization. The combination of two subchambers and connecting wiring

constitute a single compensated ion chamber. In practice the two
subchambers rarely have identical characteristics so one of the
chamber volumes is made adjustable so the degree of compensation
can be tailored to exactly cancel the gamma ionization currents.

The two compensated ion chambers are used to provide linear
indications of the power level. The chamber that feeds the linear
power recorder also supplies the flux signal for the control-rod
servo mechanism. These chambers have a useful range of about 6
decades and indicate power from a few watts up to 150% of full
power (15 Mw). Linear output over this span is achieved by 15
stages of range switching in the output amplifier. The position
of the chambers is selected to provide maximum accuracy in the

normal power range, 1-10 Mw.

3.2.4 Safety Chambers

The principal requirement of neutron detectors in the safety

system is high reliability so a relatively simple device is indicated.

The chambers in use on the MSRE are uncompensated, ionization
chambers utilizing boron for neutron sensitivity. A chamber consists
of several concentric cylinders with some of the internal surfaces
coated with boron enriched in *°B. The ionizable gas is dry nitrogen
at 1 atm pressure. Each chamber is equipped with two high-voltage
leads and two independent signal leads. The chamber output is read
as a continuous current rather than individual pulses.

The output from these chambers has a useful range of about 2
decades and the normal readout is 1-20 Mw. The MSRE installations
have a special switching arrangement that increases the amplifier
output by a factor of 10> when the fuel pump is off. Under these
conditions the instrument range is 1-20 Kw. Since the safety
chambers are uncompensated, they are not highly accurate at very
low powers, but accuracy at low power is not a regquirement of
the safety system.

L. Kinetics and Safety

There are several facets to the interest in the kinetics of the

MSRE. Is it stable, i.e., do small disturbances cause oscillations
which don't die out? Does it respond quickly and smoothly to the con-::
trols? Could damaging nuclear excursions result from any conceivable
incident?

The dynamic behavior of the MSRE is shaped largely by 1) circulating
fuel, 2) separate moderator, 3) ‘negative temperature coefficients of
reactivity, 4) relatively low heat generation rate, and 5) loose coupling
to the heat sink (air). Circulation of the fuel reduces the delayed
neutron fraction, which makes the reactivity-period relation significantly
different. This effect is important in the "zero-power” kinetics (where
temperature feedback is negligible) and in rapid nuclear excursions.

In power excursions, the negative temperature coefficient of the fuel
acts promptly as an inherent shutdown mechanism, but.the graphite con-

tributes little. Normal power operation reflects primarily the rather

s
4%

/ 10/19/65

sluggish temperature response. The graphite responds slowly to power
changes: a 1-Mw change in reactor power changes the graphite heat
generation by only 0.06 Mw and the heat capacity of the graphite is

3.6 Mw—sec/OF, giving an initial rate of change of lOF/min. Further-
more the heat transfer to the fuel takes effect slowly: the transfer
amounts to 0.02 MW/OF, giving a time constant for the graphite of |
3.6/0.02 = 180 sec. The transfer of heat through a considerable resis-
tance to a low-temperature heat sink makes for sluggish response. Some
indication of this is the time constant which is the ratio of reactor
heat capacity, 12 Mw-sec/oF, to the heat transfer in the radiator. At
10 Mv the heat transfer is 10 Mw/1000°F = 0.010 Mw/°F and the time
constant is 1200 sec. (20 min.). At 1 Mw, the heat transfer area is
reduced, giving a time constant of almost 3 hours.

L.l Stability and Transient Response

The MSRE is stable under &ll conditions. At low power, however,

the margin of stability is not great and low-frequency oscillations
tend to die out slowly if no external reactivity control is applied.
This "wallowing" has a characteristic period of several minutes, so
it is easily flattened out by movements of the regulating rod.
Without any rod control, the negative temperature coefficient of
reactivity causes the nuclear power to follow changes in heat removal
rate and eventually level off at the same value. The servo control
system "tightens up" the response causing the nuclear power to follow
more dquickly with little or no overshoot or undershoot.
4.2 Potential Accidents

There are several more or less concelivable incidents in which

nuclear heating could produce undesirably high temperatures and pressures
inside the fuel salt system. These are described and discussed in de-
tail in ORNL TM-732, The MSRE Safety Analysis Report.

4.2.1 Uncontrolled Rod Withdrawal

Perhaps the most severe reactivity excursion which could be

considered credible is simultaneous and continued withdrawal of all
three rods past the criticel positions. If this happened under

the worst conditions and there were no corrective action, the
Approved. bYﬂVé ‘\/ff:f-/ W 2B-22
v )

10/19/65

power would surge to between 400 and 500 Mw for a fraction of a
second, then drop back to around 50-100 Mw. The fuel temperature
would rise very rapidly; within 6 sec. after the peak power, the
maximum fuel temperature in the core would be above l8OOOF. The
core would see a pressure surge of about 20 psi. Rod scram on
either l-sec. period or 15-Mw power would limit the excursion to
tolerable proportions even if one of the three rods failed to
drop.

4.2.2 "Cold-Siug”

This is a postulated accident in which the mean temperature of

the core decreases rapidly because fuel is injected at an abnor-
mally low temperature, creating a reactivity excursion by virtue

of the negative temperature coefficient of reactivity. The most
likely way in which such an accident could happen would be for the
fuel external to the reactor vessel to be cooled off while the

fuel pump is stopped; starting the fuel pump would then inject

the cooler fuel. All concern over this kind of cold-slug accident
was eliminated by requiring that the control rods be fully inserted
before the fuel pump can be started. With the rods down, no possible
cold slug could make the reactor critical, much less cause an
excursion.

4.2.3 Filling Accident

The reactor could go critieal. with the core only part full of
fuel if: (1) the control rods were withdrawn too far, (2) the
core temperature were too low, or (3) the fuel were abnormally
concentrated in uranivm. The position of the control rods will
be prescribed for each fill, and it is up to the operator to see
they are not withdrawn too far. Administrative control is also
used to assure that the temperature is high enough. A control
interlock requires that the rods be withdrawn part way before a
£ill starts. Should the reactor go supercritical during a fill,
the rods would scram either on a l-gec. period or at 15 Kw. This
will stop the excursion and if the reason for criticality was

either high rods or low temperature, the reactor will not go

4
Approved b¥¢ﬁ§;%?;43£:ﬂkwn\_ 2B-23
" Y

10/19/65

critical again. Abnormal concentration of uranium is extremely
unlikely, but separation by selective freezing in the drain tank
is theoretically possible even to a degree that would make the
reactor critical with the rods in. Thus in order to prevent
undesirably high core temperatures in the third type of filling
accident, safety interlocks stop the fill when the rods drop.
4.2.4 UO, Precipitation

Separation of uranium from the circulating fuel could lead to

local overheating under deposits or reactivity disturbances if the
uranium shifts position. The only known way for uranium to become
concentrated in the loop is by gross contamination of the salt
with moisture to form UOs,. Precautions against moisture, backed
by the presence of ZrF,, make UO, precipitation extremely unlikely.
Nevertheless, the operation will be watched carefully for possible
signs of such a condition: temperature differences between the
reactor vessel and incoming salt is one indication, another is the
reactivity balance which would show the loss of uranium. Rod
scram at 15 Mw would protect against excursions caused by fast
recovery of up to 700 g of uranium or more. The l-sec. scram
gives protection against even larger excursions by starting the
rods dropping earlier in the excursion.
4.2.5 Others

If the fuel pump stops, the reactivity tends to increase, but
the change is slow and is easily controlled by the temperature
interlocks and the 15-Kw scram with the pump off. Afterheat
problems are moderate in the MSRE because the power density in the
fuel is low. If the fuel were stopped in the core the temperature
rise would increase only l5OOF over about 20 hours. Fuel in the
drain tanks could increase much more, were it not for the heat
removal by the thimbles. Criticality in the drain tanks could
occur only if the uranium were concentrated near the center of the
tank by more than a factor of four. This is very unlikely, if not
impossible. However, should such occur, the chain reaction would

level off at heat-loss power without causing damage.

SECTION 3

OPERATION OF AUXTILIARY SYSTEMS

In the normal operation of the MSRE practically all of the installed
equipment must function in an integrated manner, with a high degree of
interdependence. It is convenient, however, to regard the reactor com-
plex as an assembly of individual systems. The central part of the
MSRE operation consists of transferring the fuel salt, circulating it
through the core, sustaining a fission chain reaction in the core and
removing the heat from the fuel — all under controlled conditions. This
rart of the operation requires not only the primary components, but
absolutely depends upon the operation of the so-called "auxiliary"
systems. (These are auxiliary in the sense of being subservient to,
or supporting, the primary systems, not in the sense of substitute or
reserve. Only a few components are auxiliary in the latter sense.)

The startup and operation of each of these systems are described

in this section.

3A ELECTRICAL SYSTEM

The 7503 Area 1is supplied from the ORNL substation by either of two
13.8 kv TVA power lines, a preferred line or an alternate. These are
separated by two interlocked pole mounted motor operated line switches.
Automatic transfer is provided from the preferred line to the alternate
line. Both transfer switches can be operated remotely from the auxiliary
control room.

The normal AC power enters the 7503 area from the 13.8 kv feeder
(between the transfer switches) through two transformer substations.

A 1500 kva, 480v, 3-phase substation serves the process equipment, and

a 750 kva, 480v, 3-phase auxiliary station is for building services, that
is, lighting, ventilation, etc. The auxiliary substation has no emergency
source, but the process station has three diesel-generators for emergency
AC use. Some of the process area lights can be supplied from either
substation,

There are two separate area IC systems, 250v system and a 48v system.
These are normally operated by AC-IC motor-generator sets and have battery
supplies for emergency use.

This section will cover operation of all equipment from the two 13.8 kv
power supply lines to, but not including, the breakers for individual
equipment. These breakers will be covered with the equipment involved.,

1 SYSTEM STARTUP
1.1 Alternating Current System

Normal power is supplied to the area by closing motor-
operated pole line switch 129 in the preferred feeder, ORNL
Circuit 23L4. This switch can be closed remotely from ACR
Panel 11 in the auxiliary control room or manually at Pole B -
north of Building T7503. An indicating light on ACR Panel 11
indicates when voltage is available on ORNL Circuit 234, and
lights above the control switch indicate whether switch 129 is
open or closed. The manual-automatic selector switch should be

placed in the automatic position.

10/ /65

1.1 (continued)

Power is supplied to the T750-kva auxiliary power substation

for building services by closing the manual pole switch located
at the sub-station east of Building T7503.

Next, close the manual breakers to the L80v, 3-phase Distri-
bution Panels 1 and 2, which are located at Column D4 on the
8L0-ft level of the building, this will bring service power into
the building. Distribution Panels 1 and 2 breakers can then
be closed as required to put equipment in service as indicated in
Tables I, II, & ITI.

Power is supplied to the 150C kva process power switchgear
by closing the manual primary disconnect switch located at the
substation west of Building T7503.

The process equipment switchgear and motor control centers
are located in the switch house which is west of the main
building and south of the process power substation. This room
contains most of the breakers for energizing the process equip-
ment. The buses for the process equipment are energized by
closing the following breakers from the 1500 kva switchgear
in the switch house except as noted below:

1.1.1 Breaker R brings power from the substation to 1500 kva
switchgear bus. (TVA BUS)
1.1.2 Breakers S and Breaker A-1 energizes Bus No. 3. Close

Breaker A-1 from DP-3 or DMP-3. (A-1 is interlocked not

) 3 EMERGENCY AND SPECIAL QPERATIONS
" 3.1 Alternate Feeder Operation

In the event that electrical power is lost on the preferred
feeder, ORNL Circuit 234, and if there is still voltage on the
alternate line, ORNL Circuit 294, after a preset time of
1 to 10 sec, switch 129 will open and 229 will close. Switch
129 will not open during an outage of <6 sec. Table IV lists
breakers and starters which need to be reclosed after a momen-
tary power outage that cannot be closed from the main control

” board. Start Equipment listed in Tables V and VI that was
operating before the momentary loss of TVA power. DNote: TUse

* control room and walking logs to determine equipment to be

. restarted. The starters and breakers will have to be reclosed
after momentary outages, or when TVA power is resumed.

Since there is no automatic feature for transferring from
the alternate feeder back to the preferred line, this becomes
a manual procedure, and should be done as soon as Clircuit 23&
has been restored. (See section 3A.3.3.2.)

3.2 Complete TLoss of TVA Power ‘
When voltage is lost on both TVA feeders or if the fault
B is between switch 129 and 229, switch 129 will open and 229

will not close. Alternating current must then be supplied by
- the diesel generators. ©OSwitch 129 will have to be closed manu-
ally when TVA power is restored.

3.2.1 Diesel Startup Procedure

- 3.2.1.1 Dispatch an operator to the diesel house to start

at step 3.2.1.8 below, meanwhile:
3.2.1.2 Push "start" button for Diesel Generator No. 3

on DPM-3, Generator voltage increase on DPM-3 will
indicate when unit starts. The diesel will crank
for 10 seconds and if not started will repeat after
10 seconds for up to 3 attempts. If diesel fails to
start, open fuel ignitor valve and turn on fuel ig-
nitor pump motor switch (both located on west side of

diesel) and repeat start.

3B INSTRUMENT AIR AND SERVICE AIR SYSTEMS

The instrument air system supplies clean, dry, compressed air for
pneumatic instruments and other special uses. Two Joy compressors ACL
and AC2 are used to compress the air, which then passes through an
aftercooler and entraimment separator to a common line supplying two
parallel receiving tanks. From the receiving tanks, the air passes
through one of two parallel drying stations containing Trinity heatless
dryers. The dry ailr is distributed through headers to locally mounted
filter and reducing stations. Two nitrogen cylinder banks provide
emergency gas pressure to headers serving the more important equipment.

The service air system supplies air for pneumatic tools, etc.

One Joy air compressor and receiver tank are provided. The compressed
air without drying is distributed to stations located in various parts
of the building. Service air can also be used for emergency cooling
of freeze valves normally supplied by component cooling pump No. 3
(see 3D) and can be valved into the instrument air system upstream at
the receiver tanks if required.

l.1l Instrument Air Compressors

1.1.1 Check that the cooling tower water system is in opera-
tion and water flow is adequate to each compressor head
and after-cooler.

1.1.2 Check the oil level in each air compressor crank case.

1.1.3 Check that the electrical and control power is on to
each compressor.

1.1.4 Check the air valving. Open the valves in the com-
pressor discharge lines and the supply and discharge lines
t0 both receiver tanks. (Both instrument air receiver
tanks will be left on-stream.)

1.1.5 Check tﬁé drain-valves. Open valves in the drain lines
from the entraimment separator, receiver tanks, and line
filters downstream of the receiver tanks. Close valves

in the lines, bypassing the drain line traps.

1.5.4 To start the motor, switch the electro-pneumatic
selector switch to the "hand" position. The compressor
will load up and will subsequently unlcad and load auto-
matically to maintain the set pressure. If usage is small
it may be desirable to set the selector switch to "Auto.”
The compressor will then start and stop to maintain the

desired pressure.

2 NORMAL OPERATION

2.1

Instrument Air Compressors

28

One instrument air compressor is normally in operation with
the other in standby. Periodic checks should be made to
assure that there is adequate cooling water flow to the com-
pressors and aftercoolers, and that the water traps are oper-
ating properly. Any abnormal vibration or noise should be
investigated.

Instrument Air Dryers

2.3

One of the instrument air dryers is normally in operation.
The other should be in standby with the power off and valves
closed. Periodic checks should be made to see that the purge
and dryer bleed flows are adequate, the dryers are cycling,
and the air is dry.

Instrument Air Distribution

2.4

Periodic checks should be made of the air flow rate and header
pressures. The filters will be periodically blown down.

Imergency Instrument Air Supply

The two six cylinder banks of nitrogen cylinders will be full
at all times. ©One bank will be connected to the emergency

air headers through PCV 9006, which will be set to open at 65

psig. The other will be valved off and in standby. All
cylinder valves on both banks will be open.

2.5 Service Air Compressor

The service air compressor is not normally in operation unless
needed for pneumatic tools or emergency cooling for freeze
valves in the coolant cell or fuel processing cell.. When in
service, periodic checks should be made as described in 2.1
above. |

3 EMERGENCY OR SPECIAL OPERATIONS

3.1 Loss of Instrument Air Pressure

Abnormal air usage or compressor troubles could cause the
instrument air pressure to drop. Alarms will occur and the
standby compressor will start. If the pressure continues to
drop, the critical air headers will be supplied with nitrogen
from the emergency nitrogen banks. When the on-stream bank
pressure drops to approximately 100 psig, this bank should be
isolated and the standby bank put on stream. Cylinders should
be replaced as used. Any unnecessary usage should be reduced
while operating on emergency supply. When the compressors
are put back on stream, normal usage can be resumed. Pipes
and valves are provided for cross-tieing the service air
compressor with the instrument air compressors upstream of
the dryers.

3.2 Loss of Cooling Tower Water to the Compressors

Cooling tower water is normally used to cool the compressors
and aftercoolers. However, connections are provided for the
emergency use of process water. Hand valve 880 must be closed
and 872 opened.

3C WATER SYSTEM

Potable water as supplied to the MSRE from the X-10 water system is
used for drinking and sanitary purposes and for fire protection. After
passing through a backflow preventer, the water is called process water
and is used in the liquid waste system, in the vapor-condensing system,
for general clean-up of equipment, as makeup for the cooling tower water
system, and for cooling of the charcoal beds. Two 520-gpm centrifugal
punmps are provided for circulating cooling tower water, which is cooled
by a two-fan induced draft cooling tower. The cooling tower water is
used for air compressors, air conditioners, in the chemical plant, for
the lube-oil systems, in the charcoal beds, and for condensing steam
from the drain tank steam domes. (Process water can also be used for
this.) Cooling :tower water is also used in a shell-and-tube heat
exchanger to provide cooling for the treated water system. Two 230-gpm
centrifugal pumps circulate treated water in a closed loop to cool in-
cell components. Makeup water is supplied by condensing building steam
in a shell and tube heat exchanger using cooling tower water as the
coolant. Treated water is also used to fill the Nuclear Instrument
penetration. This water is continucusly recirculated through a closed
loop by a 5-gpm pump to maintain uniformity of the water condition
throughout the penetration. The water is treated with 2000 ppm of a
mixture of 25% potassium tetraborate and 75% potassium nitrite to mini-
mize corrosion. Steam condensate is also used to supply water to the
feedwater tanks. Thiskuntreated water is used in the drain tank bayonets
to remove decay heat from the reactor fuel after the reactor has been
drained.

water inlet to the bayonets, approx. 5 in., and below the steam
outlet at 7-in. elevation. Other water levels can be used by
controlling the water inlet flow using the ICV 806 or ICV 807.
However, this increases the stresses and might shorten the life of
the bayonets. If the ICV's are used the water flow must be stopped

Iow cooling tower water pressure will switch the supply to

to process water (HCV 882C1). Process water can be turned on
manuvally to the instrument air compressors by opening V 872
and closing V880. q
Treated Water System.

Nuclear contamination of the treated water system, monitored
by RIA 827, will close block valves in all the discharge water
lines from the reactor and drain tank cells. Then high pressure
will close HSV 844 in the supply line to the thermal shield. All
inlet water lines into the reactor cell and drain tank cell
contain check valves which prevent backleakage of activity.

If activity in the cooling water is the only (or most
critical) incident at the time, dispatch an operator and H. P.
representative to the water room to survey the water piping for
activity. Check the common return lines. If radioactive, check
the return lines from the RC and DTC space coolers. If one or more
are free of activity, close HV's in the supply to and the return
from all dther in-cell eguipment. Then raise the setpoint on the
activity monitor (RIA 827) to open the block valve in this line,

which will allow space coolers to be operated and prevent buildup

- Expansion of water after the block valves close is released
through 100 psi pressure relief valves which discharge to the
waste tank except in the case of the thermal shield. Rupture
disks in 1855 from the thermal shield water lines 8Lk4 and 845
relieve at 18 psi to the vapor~condensing system. Also, to
prevent damage to the thermal shield if the inlet block valve
(Fsv 84k4) leaks, a flow-limiting orifice in L 84k has sufficient
AP to carry the entire water capacity at full pump head.

All water lines which can be exposed to subfreezing

Normal shutdown of an entire cooling water system requires
that there be no demand on that system during the down time.
The circulation of either the CTW system or the TW system can be
stopped by stopping the circulating pump on MB No. 2. The cooling
tower fans can also be shut off from MB-2.

Any of the parallel paths of the cooling watér systems can
be isolated by closing supply and discharge hand valves. This

allows the rest of the system to continue operation.

3D COMPONENT COOLING SYSTEMS

Cooling is needed to prevent overheating of the reactor neck, control
rods, and fﬁél pump, and for freezing the freeze valves.

Components located in the reactor and drain tank cells are cooled by
the primary component coolant system which circulates reactor and drain
tank cell air, using rotary type positive displacement blowers. Two
blowers (CCP' No., 1 and No, 2) are installed, but only one is used at a time.
The other serves as an emérgency standby unito

Freeze valves located in the coolant drain tank cell and fuel proceésing
cell are cooled by a secondary system using atomspheric air. The prime mover
is another rotary type positive displacement blower (CCP No. 3). Emergency
backup is provided by air from the auxiliary air compressor.

4.1.3 Inspection of Primary System Blowers - Since CCP No. 1 and
CCP No. 2 are located inside tanks which are part of the

sary. The filter element and oil should be changed if the
.blbwer has operated >2000 hr since the last change, or if an
extended run is planned. Inspection and maintenance of the
oil system can be made by opening the 12-in. flanged in-
spection port on the blower containment tanks. The drive

belts should also be examined at this time.

5 NORMAL SHUTDOWN

When cooling air is no longer needed, the operatlng blowers can be

shut down by pushing the "stop" button on MB No, 3.
If maintenance is to be performed on part of the system, valves

should‘be closed to isolate that part of the system.

3E SHIELD AND CONTAINMENT

The detailed steps in getting the reactor shield ready for operation
and checking containment are covered in the Startup Check List, Section
4E. HoWever, the general plan to be followed, reasons for actions taken,
ete., are given below for each area.

The maximum credible accident for the MSRE consists of a simultaneous
rupture of a molten-salt line or vessel and the presence of the proper
amount of water, presumable due to a rupture of one of the ccooling-water
lines or the thermal shield. In this case the pressure could rise to
110 psig if it were not for the vapor condensing system, which will limit
the rise to 39 psig. The maximum allowable leak rate from the reactor
and drain tank cells when they are pressurized to 39 psig is 1% of their
volume in 24 hours (180 ft3/day). This is checked at a positive pressure
(20 psig) after each time the reactor or drain tank cells have been Opened
for maintenance or inspection. Vapor condensing system is tested simul-
taneously, but separately, with reactor and drain tank cells. The cells
are operated at 12.7 psia, and the leak rate is continuously monitored
while the reactor is in operation.

Since any line in the cell could rupture during the maximum credible
accident, containment must be provided for each. These are checked peri-
odically as indicated in the Startup Check list, Section L4E.

1 REACTOR AND DRAIN TANK CELL

1.1 Startup

After all maintenance in the cells is finished, install

all lower blocks, weld the seal pans in place, check the seal
pans with the cells at 2 psig, and alternate top blocks in
place. Maximum spacing between blocks is 24 inches.

Since the air line block valves close at a cell pressure
of 2 psig, careful consideration should be given to the condi-.
tion of the reactor and drain tank system before starting the
cell pressurization. If there are no leaks in the air lines
to the air operated valves, they will not change position during
the period that the block valves are closed. Therefore, all

vent valves from, and equalizing valves between, the reactor
Approved by ﬂxﬁﬁfiz/t}ﬁicxaazn4 e
= g/ 8"16 "65

and drain tanks should be opened at the time the block wvalves

close. The drain tank and reactor systems should be vented to
atmospheric pressure before closing the block valves. Jumpers
in Circuits 33, 3&, and 35 will prevent the block valves from

closing.

As an added precaution against unintentional transferring
of salt, “the transfer and fill freeze valves should be frozen.
Since the component coolant pump will not be in operation, power
to the heaters on the freeze valves should be shut off, and the
power to the adjacent line heaters should be reduced.so that
the freeze valves remain frozen without coolant air.

When no pan leaks are visible at 2 psig, install all top
blocks and pressurize the cell to 20 psig, hold the cell temper-
ature constant, and check the leak rate by observing the cell
pressure. (For calculation of leak rate, see Section 3E.l1.Z.,
Part VIII, MSRE Operating Procedures). The space coolers should
be on at this time if possible.

If the leak rate is above the specified limit (see Table
3E-1 this section), all block and check valves and rupture disks
in the lines connecting the cell atmosphere will need to be tested.
It may be necegsary to retest the seal pans.

When the leak rate is satisfactory, reduce the pressure in
the cells to -2 psig, and again check the leak rate. The pressure
should not normally be reduced lower than —2;1/2 psig. An alarm
will occur at -3 psig, and the block valve (HCV-565) will close.
At -4 psig the component coolant pump will automatically be shut
off. (The space coolers and component coolant pump should be in
operation).

If this leak rate is satisfactory, the pressure will be main-
tained at -2 psig, and the cell wili be purged with nitrogen until
the oxygen content is less than 5%.

The procedure outlined above tests only the contaimment of
penetrations directly into the cell atmosphere. It is also nec-

essary to test each line which connects with the reactor or drain-
’ Approved byﬁﬁﬁﬁﬁez/ ‘Ut e o , 3E-3

tank system and extends outside of contaimment. Also since

during an accident any of the service lines entering the re-

actor or the drain tank cell could be ruptured, it is nec-

essary to provide contaimment for these lines and to periodi-

cally check the adequacy of each of these. The general method
: of containment is described below. Details of the methods

used for checking the containment are given in Section LE.

ential. Standard T & P are 32°F and 1L4.7 psia.

All cover gas lines which enter the system contain a mini-
mum of one soft-seated check valve to prevent backflow. Also,

v the supply header pressure is maintained higher than could con-
ceilvably be developed in the system. These are tested by gas

pressurization.
Approved by /ﬁgﬂf%«wﬂm 3E-L
| </ 8-16-65

All the off-gas lines are blocked by a common block valve
which is closed on high activity in the line upstream of the
absolute filters in the ventilation system. In addition, those
lines which normally contain fission gases are jacketed (double
pipe) upstream of the charcoal beds. This is tested by gas
pressurization.

The cell evacuation line contains a radiation block wvalve
prior to the absolute filters. This is tested by gas pressuri-
zation (see Section 4E, Part VIII, MSRE Operating Procedures).

All cooling water lines which enter the cell have soft-
seated check valves to prevent backflow. The cooling water
lines which leave the cell contain radiation block valves.

Taps are provided to enable pressurization of the in-cell
equipment to test the check valves and block wvalves.

The surge tank also contains a block valve on the vent and
a spring closed valve on the chemical gddition line. These are
tested by alr pressurization.

The oil systems are closed systems. They are checked leak-
tight periocdically by pressurizing the entire systems, and ad-
ministrative control is used to assure that no changes are made
during operation which might violate containment.

The steam condensing system for the drain tank coolers is
a closed system except for the water supply lines which contain
soft-seated check valves and the vent line which goes to the
vapor condensing system. These check valves are tested during
testing of the vapor condensing system.

The coolant salt system is a closed system. Auxiliary
lines connected to this system have similar contaimment to the
fuel system. These are tested in place by gas pressurization
wherever possible; otherwise, they are removed from the system
and bench tested.

The cell sump jet supply lines contain-soft-seated check
valves, and the discharge lines contain two valves in series
which close on high cell pressure. The check valves are tested

when the cell is at pressure. A test line is provided for
Approved by wfi’@/\/cf;//uﬂ .

testing the block valves.

All lines to the fuel sampler contain soft-segted check
vaives, and the supply header pressure is maintained higher
than the pressure which could be developed in the sampler.
These are tested by gas pressurization.

The leak detector system is a closed system which is oper-
ated at a higher pressure than could conceivably be developed
in the reactor. Administrative control is used to assure safe
operation and maintenance.

The helium supply lines to the fuel pump, fuel overflow
tank and fuel and flush salt drain tanks are provided with
secondary containment to a point upstream of the check valves
in these lines. The containment enclosures are connected to
the RC or DIC but sealed off from them. These are leak tested
by gas pressurization.

All instrument air lines and valve operator vent lines
contain block valves which close on high cell pressure. These
are tested by gas pressurization.

When the containment of all the penetrations is known to
be satisfactory, the cell leak rate is below permissible limits,
and the O, content of the RC and DIC atmosphere is less than 5%,
the RC and DIC are ready for operstion.

1.2 Normal Operation

- The reactor and drain tank cell will be operated at -2 psig.
This is accomplished by throttling V 569A. The evacuation rate
is measured by FyI 569 downstream of V 569A. A nitrogen purge
will be maintained at a rate such that the oxygen content of
the cell does not exceed 5%, as indicated by sampling cell air
or use of a continuous Os analyzer. The purge nitrogen enters
the cells at the sumps and provides the gas for the bubbler
level indicator. A probe type level alarm is also installed

r in each sump. These are tied into a common annunciator. Water
cannot be tolerated in either cell and should be jetted immedi-
ately. Continued buildup of water will necessitate shutting
down and repairing the leak. The procedure for sampling and

jetting the sump is given in Section 3J.
Approved by ﬂ. Zd/% / Mgy

The cell leakage should not exceed 1% of the cell volume
in 24 hr at 39 psig and 285°F. The rate of inleakage to the

3E-6

cell can be calculated from (l) the change in cell pressure

and temperature or (2) the change in oxygen content. Several

temperature-compensating-reference-volume tanks are located in

the cells which when used as references for differential-

pressure-measuring instruments eliminate the need for adjusting

During operation the average temperature of the cells is
maintained at lBOOFJ or less by controlling the water flow to
the three space coolers.

The cell air activity and oxygen concentration is monitored
in the component coolant system, line 565, and therefore the
pump must be in operation at all times.

Fmergency or Special Operation

Cell air activity will stop the cell evacuation by closing
HCV-565, and will give an emergency fuel drain. A rupture of
in-cell piping or the loss of cooling water to the space coolers
will cause the cell pressure to rise. When the pressure reaches
16.7 psia, all block valves will close. No automatic blocking
action occurs on the valves in the cell ventilation lines, _
HCV-930A, HCV-930B, V-955A, or V-955B, and therefore these are
tagged closed at the start of each run. It is highly important
that they never be opened during operation.

If the pressure rises to 15 psig, the 3" rd ruptures and at
~ 20 psig the 12" rupture disc to the vapor condensing system
will break, relieving the cell pressure.

Residual air activity in the cells can be purged through

the auxiliary charcoal beds by opening V-571A and V-571B.

Shutdown

Shutdown of the reaétor and drain tank cells consists essen-
tially of shutting off the cell evacuation valves and venting
the system to atmospheric pressure. This is best done by opening
HV-955A and B, which bypass the 30 inch motor-operated valves
(HCV-930A and B) in the cell ventilation line. When the cell
has been vented, the motor-operated valves can be opened to pro-

vide ventilation for maintenance operations.

. 2. VAPOR-CONDENSING SYSTEM

2.1

2.2

Startup

Putting the vapor-condensing system in condition for opera-
tion consists of filling VI 1 two-thirds full of corrosion-
inhibited water, checking that the rupture disk bypass valve,
V-980Q, the vent valve, V-98kL, are tagged "closed'.

Normal Operation

The wvapor-condensing system should require lLititle or no
attention during operation. Should the water level in VI 1
drop below the lower intermediate probe, it should be replen-
ished.. Approval of the operations chief should be obtained
before filling. If the level continues to drop, it will be
necessary to shut down the reactor and determine the source of
leaks. (See Section 3E.2.4 Part VIII, MSRE Operating Procedures).
If the system pressure rises above 15 psia as indicated by PIA
VI 2, the system should be vented to the stack through HV-98L.
This valve should not be opened without the shift supervisor's
permission and should be closed and tagged after venting.

Emergency and Special Operations

If the pressure in the reactor cell has increased to 15
psig, the 3" rupture disc will break, and at 20 psig the 12"
rupture disc will break. Vapors from the reactor and drain
tank cells will be discharged into VI 1, where the gases will
be scrubbed and any steam condensed; the noncondensables will
be retained in VI 2 and the vapor space of VI 1. The activity

in the viecinity of the vapor condensing system may be as high
2.4

3E-10
8-16-65
as 100 rads/hr at this time.

As the reactor cell cools, its pressure will decrease, and
the gases will be pulled back into the cell through CV's 980A
and 980B. Any remaining pressure in VT-2 can be vented to the
stack through V-984. However, any gas pressure remaining in
VT-2 will be disposed of after the situation has been carefully
reviewed. ©Special instructions will be issued at the time
covering any other operations.

Shutdown Operation

A periodic leak test of this system will be performed and
the leak-rate shall not exceed 1% of the volume in 24 hours
at 39 psig and 140°F. The leak test when performed will be
performed simultaneously with the RC and DIC leak test but as
a separate test.

For this operation V-980 shall be opened when pressurizing
the RC and DIC and then closed for the leak tests. The detailed
steps for the leak test are given in Section UE, Part VIII,

MSRE Operating Procedures. The allowable leak rate 1is given
in Table 3E-2.

3 COOIANT CELL AND COOIANT DRAIN TANK CELL

3.1

Startup

3.2

Preparation for operation consists of installing blccks
on the top of the penthouse; closing the doors between the
coolant drain tank cell and the west tunnel, between the
coolant drain tank cell and the blower house and between the
coolant cell and the blower house (These doors should be
locked and signs should be installed to prevent entry by
personnel during operation.); putting the two coolant cell
space coolers in operation; and providing adequate ventilation
as described in 3F.

Normal Operation

3.3

In normal operation the radiation level in these areas
will be too high for personnel entry. The cell temperature
should be maintained at 150°F, or less, with the space coolers.

Water leaking into the cell will flow by gravity to the
sump pump pit and will be automatically pumped to the catch
basin.

Emergency or Special Operation

A leak of salt from the coolant or coolant drain tank
systems into the cell would probably be detected by losses
in coolant salt inventory. Air samples taken from the ventila-
tion duct may show an increase in beryllium concentration.
In case of a rupture of a salt line, it would be possible if
water were present to develop a slight pressure and release
some beryllium to the high bay, blower house, west tunnel or
special equipment room. However, since these areas are vented
to the containment stack, the amount of atmospheric contami-
nation would be small. In case of an accident of this nature,
gas masks should be worn until the conditions have been

adequately analyzed.

3.4  Shutdown

After the reactor has been shut down for 15 minutes, access

to the area is possible before the coolant salt is drained.
Adequste health physics and beryllium surveys sould be made
before entry.

SPECIAL EQUIPMENT ROOM

The special equipment room may be entered from the coolant
drain tank cell or by removing blocks from above. During ocperation
at power the radiation level is too high for continued occupancy;
however, by entering through the top, short term operations or main-
tenance jobs can be done. A health physics survey ié necessary be-
fore entry.

WEST TUNNEL AND SOUTH ELECTRICAL SERVICE AREA

These areas are not accessible during operation of the reactor,
but they may be entered when the reactor is drained. Positive per-
sonnel barriers and warning signs must be provided before startup.
A health physics survey is necessary before entry after shutdown.

CHARCOAL BED PIT

The shielding blocks on the charcoal bed pit should not be re-
moved without administrative approval. Air leakage into this pit
is vented to the ventilation stack. An inleakage will be limited
by caulking around the blocks.

FILTER PIT

The ventilation system filters are installed in a pit south of
the building. Top shielding is provided by means of concrete blocks,
which are caulked to prevent air or rain leaking in.

Entry should be necessary only for maintenance and should be
done with administrative approval.

AUXILIARY CELLS

The liguid waste cell, remote-maintenance practice cell, fuel
storage cell, decontamination cell, equipment storage cell, and a
spare cell are located below the 852 ft level in the high-bay area
north of the drain tank cell.

The activity levels in these cells are independent of the re-
actor operation. Entry should be made only after a health physics

survey.

3F VENTILATION SYSTEM

The ventilation system provides ventilation to all areas where
radioactive contamination or beryllium dust is likely to occur. The
relative pressures are maintained so that the flow of air is from the
less hazardous to the more hazardous areas. Dampers are provided in the
discharge ducts from each area to enable balancing the flow for the
specific operation in progress. Ailr flows from the ducts to a header
which feeds three filter banks connected in parallel. Suction to the
filter banks is provided by either of two parallel 19,000-cfm stack
fans which discharge to a 100-ft high containment stack.

No. 2 stack fan will start automatically on high pres-
sure at the suction of the filters.)

1.1.4 Check that the discharge damper from stack fan No. 1 is
open and from No. 2 is closed.

1.2 Ventilation Distribution

Stack Fans and Filters

2,2

Stack fan No. 1 will normally be in service with No. 2 in standby
ready for automatic stértupo._NOTE: Stack fan No, 1 will not start
automatically. All three filters should be operated in parallel,
Periodic checks should be made of the stack flow, suction pressure,
filter pressure drop, and stack:rédiation monitor. Any abnormal
vibration or noise should be investigated.

Ventilation Distribution

The reactor and drain cellé will be sealed and held at a negative
pressure (=12.7 psia) using the component coolant pumps. The two‘
block valves in the 30-in. reactor cell ventilation line will be
closed. The coolant cell, coolant drain tank cell, spécial equip-
ment room, south electric service area, fuel processing cell, and
liquid waste cell will normally be closed énd caulked. The de-
contamination cell, equipment storage cell, and spare cell may be
open or closed depending upon conditions in that cell. The high-
bay supply air damper should be open and doors to the high-bay
closed. HCV 935A in the discharge ffom the high-bay area should
be open. The high-bay area will be maintained at a negative pres-
sure of -0,1 to-0.3 in. of water. The dampers in the exhaust lines
frbm the coolant cell, coolant drain tank cell, special equipment
room, fuel processing cell, and liquid waste cell will be open'to
maintain these at a lower pressure than the high bay. The waste
blower should be in operation. The dampers to the decontamination
cell, equipment storage cell; and spare cell will be adjusted to as-
sure a flow of air from the high bay into these cells if they con-
tain potentially hazardoué material., Normally the dampers in the
exhaust ducts from the transmitter room and north electric service
area éhould be closed and the dampers in the duct from the south
electric service area should be open, This will cause the air to
flow from the 840-ft level to the transmitter room, then to the
north electric service area, then to the south electric service
area and subsequently to the stack. The dampers in the ducts

from the service tunnel and vent house will be adjusted to keep

them at a lower pressure than atmospheric. There are no dampers

or valves in the ventilation lines from the off-gas containment

boxes or charcoal beds.

Periodic checks should be made of the relative pressures
and air flows. Due to possible cave-in of the high bay, the
vacuum should not exceed —0.3 in. of water.

Other areas and equipment are ventilated by separate ventilating

fans in the respective locations. They are as follows:

2.3.1 The "Sump Room" is ventilated by means of an exhaust
blower. The on-off switch is located at the entrance to
the sump on the 852 level. The blower should run con-
tinuously and should be checked on before entering sump
roonm.

2.3.2 An exhaust fan mounted in the west wall of the MG #1
and #4 room provides ventilation for the motor generator
sets. This fan should run at all times. The off-on
switch is located at the fan.

2.3.3 The induction regulators of the salt piping heaters
are ventilated by blowers which are to run continuously
during operations. Groups of four or six induction
regulators are each ventilated by a blower in conjunction
with a small duct system. The on-off switches for these
blowers are located at the respective blowers. There is
a total of nine (9) blowers located in the induction
regulator area just north of the "Heater Control Panel”
on the 840 level.

2.3.4 The battery room is ventilated by an exhaust blower in
the east wall. Continuous ventilation in this room is
mandatory because of the evolution of hydrogen from the
batteries. The on-off switch for this blower is located
in Panel H switch #18 on the north wall of the 840 level.

2.3.5 The remote maintenance area is ventilated by a small

exhaust blower in the west wall of the room. This blower
3F-L4
Approved bm s 7/21/65

should be operated when needed. The on-off switch is
located at the blower.

2.3.6 The main disconnect panel in the motor control center
is ventilated by means of an exhaust fan. The fan is
located in the south wall of the motor control center
room with the off-on switch located in the southwest
corner of the room. This fan should be maintained running

at all times.

3 OPERATION DURING MAINTENANCE

The flow of air should continue to be from the less hazardous to

the more hazardous areas as described in 2.1 and 2.2 of this section.

Many different damper settings may be required, depending upon the

operating conditions. When increasing the air flow from one area,

caution should be used not to decrease it below tolerance in another

area .

3.1

Several anticipated conditions are described below.

Maintenance in the Reactor and/or Drain Tank Cells

Before opening either cell a check should be made of the cell

air activity, Monitor RE-565. During maintenance, both valves

in the cell exhaust line 930 will be open, and the velocity
through any opening will be maintained at no less than 100 ft/min.
When the openings into the cell are large, the high bay exhaust
valve HCV-935A will be closed. With smaller openings, it will

be necessary to open HCV-935A to provide necessary ventilation

—0.3 in. of water.

Maintenance in the Coolant or Coolant Drain Tank Cells

Direct maintenance is possible in equipment located in these
cells. A check of the radioactivity should be made by the
health physicist, and a check of beryllium contamination should
be made by the industrial hygienist before entering the cell.
The dampers in line 933 and 934 should be opened to provide

maximum ventilation.

b SPECTAL OPERATIONS

L.l Failure of Stack Fans

h.2

Should fan No. 1 stop due to mechanical or electrical fallure,
fan No. 2 controls are designed to start it automatically.

The discharge damper from stack fan No. 1 will close and the
damper from stack fan No. 2 will open. Should this fail or
should No. 2 stack fan fail while running and before No. 1
has been repaired, all personnel will be evacuvated from the
high-bay area and other limited access areas until proper
ventilation is restored. The areas should be kept closed as
much as possible when the ventilation is lost. If both blowers
stop, the waste blower will also stop and will have to be
restarted after either fan is in operation.

Replacement of Exhaust Filters

4.3

Whenever the stack filter pressure drop exceeds L in. of water,
the filters will be replaced one bank at a time while the fan
continues to operate. The auxiliary cells and other limited
access areas will be closed with their shield blocks and doors
to assure sufficient exhaust from the high-bay area while re-
placing the filters. The inlet and outlet dampers of the bank
to be replaced will be closed. The filter will be replaced
with filters which have already been subjected to the Laboratory
standard DOP smoke test, and the DOP smoke test will be re-
peated on the installation. See paragraph L.L.

Ixcess Stack Activity

If the stack instrumentation indicates excess stack activity,

tectors, a survey of each branch of the duct work and piping

leading to the fans will be made with portable instruments to
locate the source. Gas masks should be worn. Inlets to all
areas should be closed to reduce the release of activity out
of the stack.

Test of the Filters by the DOP Smoke Test

The filters will be tested to determine their efficiency for
removing particulate matter by the ORNL standard DOP smoke

test (see ORNL 3442, "Tests of High Efficiency Filters and
Filter Installations at ORNL"). The test will be performed

by the Inspection Engineering Department on replacement filters
before they are installed in the system and the installation
will be observed by Inspection Engineering personnel. The
complete filter bank will be tested after each filter change
and annually if the filters were not replaced during the pre-
ceding twelve months. They will also be tested at any time

the efficiency of the filters is suspected to be less than
99.95%. The test on the system will be conducted with a flow
of ~20,000 cfm with only one fan operating and the dampers to
all filters open. This test will be performed by the Inspection
Engineering Department and they will determine the amount of
dioctyl phthalate required for the test. The smoke will be
introduced into the system at the high-bay area exhaust duct.
Samples will be taken from the sample ports in the three filter
inlet ducts and the three filter outlet ducts. A photometer
analysis will be performed on each filter bank and should

indicate a filtering efficiency of =99.95%.

5 SHUTDOWN

Depending on conditions at the time of shutdown, it may be necessary

to close and caulk some of the auxiliary cells. After this is

complete, the waste blower in the remote maintenance cell will be

stopped and the stack fans stopped.

- 3G LEAK-DETECTOR SYSTEM

This systeﬁ is a pressurized helium system consisting of eight valve
manifolds or headers supplied from a common helium pressure~-reducing station.
Each header has from 4 up to 10 leak detector lines which serve in-cell
flanges. Each leak detector line monitors from one to . four pairs of ring-
joint flanges.

A reference tank and sensitive DP cell are connected through appropriate
valves to the eight headers so that small leaks from any one header can be
- measured.

Flange leakage can be tolerated at a rate of 6 cc/min for all inter-
- connected flanges (all headers connected). This is equivalent to a 0.66 psi
per hour pressure drop (see Sect., 11,3 of the Design Report, Part I),
All data calculations and leak rates should be recorded in the leak-

detector log.

1  STARTUP
As each leak-detector flange or group of flanges are tightened, the

leak-detector line monitoring that flange, or group of flanges, should
be purged of air and put into service by the following procedure:
Note: Leak detector line 420 serves two flanges in line 516 and it is
used as an example (numbers in parenthesis),

l.l Purging O, From Leak-Detector Headers

‘ Headers containing oxygen should be purged as outlined below
before being put into normal service.
l1.1.1 Before opening the supply valves to the leak-detector lines,
- open the helium supply valves and the valve to the header
to be purged.
1.1.2 Pressurize the header to 100 psi and close the valve upstream
of 0, contaminated section (V 514C or header supply valve),
l.1.3 Vent the header into the containment cell by opening a spare
leak-detector line valve (L 430 on header 403 is a spare until
the thermal shield water piping is cut and flanged).
l.1.4 After venting, close the valve in the spare leak-detector

line,

Close all "A" leak-detector valves on the header (420A
through 4294).,

Isolate all other headers from the pressurizing line (close
V 401A and 403A through 408A),

Pressurize header being tested to 100 psig, then close header
supply valve, (PI 402 reads 100 psig--V 514C, 514D open,

and V 402A closed).

Open or check open the "B" (maintenance valve) to the flanges
being made up (V 420B),

Slowly open the "A'" valve to the flanges being made up until
the header pressure drops 1 to 5 psi per min. This is equiv-
alent to a purge of 100 to 55 cc/min,

Open header supply valve to purge line while all flanges are
tightened (open V 402A while two flanges in line 516 are
tightened).

.7 Unless gross leakage is indicated, record PAI 400 at

Lo

10-min intervals until leak rate is established. Record
at least three 10 to 15 minute checks without equalizing.
Acceptable leak rate is 107> cc/sec. which is approximately
equivalent to a change in PAI 400 of 7% in 10 min.
1.3.8 If leak rate is not satisfactory, open the DP cell
- equalizing valve (V-400) and re-pressurize header (Open
V-4024).
- 1.3.9 After retorquing flange, test as per 1.3.4 through 1.3.8.
1.3.10 If leak rate is satisfactory, open DP equalizing valve,
V-400, and all "A" leak-detector valves on the header ex-
cept spares. (Open V-L20A and L422A through 429A and close
V-L4214).
1.3.11 Isolate header from DP cell (Close V-402B).
1.3.12 Repressurize header to 100 psig and put in normal opera-
tion. (Open V-402A until PI-402 indicates 100 psig.)
1.3.13 Close supply valve and tie all headers together. (Close
. V-514D and open V-LO1lA through L4O8A.)
2 NORMAL, OPERATION
- During normal operation the DP equalizing valve (V-400) is open.
All headers are isolated from the DP cell (V-LO1B through LO8B closed).
All headers are tied together (V-LOlA through 4O8A open). A1l "A"

and "B" leak-detector-line valves 410 through 489 (except spares)
are open. The pressure drop of PIA 514 is an indication of the leak
rate of the total leak-detector system. PIA 51k annunciates at 90
and 110 psig.

When low annunciation occurs, the system pressure (PIA 51L)
should be recorded in the leak detector log and the leak rate calcu-
lated. If leak rate is normal (<0.66 psi/hr pressure drop) repres-

i surize system (V—SlhD) and record time and pressure.
If calculated pressure drop is greater than 0.66 psi/hr, de-

termine the location of leak as described in Section 3.

4. SHUTDOWN PROCEDURES

Reactor Shutdown

During a reactor shutdown the leak-detector system will remain in
operation as described in Section 2,

Leak~-Detector Header Shutdown

A header may need to be shut down to repair an item connecting
directly to the header, that is, a damaged valve, leaking fitting,
etc. To shut down and vent a header, proceed as follows:
4,2,1 With the system at pressure and the header supply valves
open, close all valves to the header except the valve needing

repairs.,

header supply valve needs repairing, close all other header
supply valves ("A'" wvalves) and open the "B" valves to L 400
for all headers except the one to be repaired.

4,2,3 Close V 514B and C,

Note: If repairs are being made during reactor operation,
they should be completed before L 400 pressure drops to the
90 psi alarm point.

4.2.,4 Vent the header to be repaired by opening a spare leak-

- detector line into the contained cells, When the header
pressure reaches zero, close the spare leak-detector line

3H INSTRUMENTATTION

1 CONTROLLERS AND INDICATORS

There are a number of different types of recorder/indicator con-

trollers at the MSRE. The maintenance and adjustment of these is the
responsibility of the instrument department. Changing of control action
settings will not normally be done by the operations personnel. If it is
necessary to make changes these should be noted in the console log and
punch listed for the instrument department to check.

The following is a brief description of the primary functions,
means of adjustment and method of setting the variables. The Foxboro
Company Consotrol Stabilog and Hyper-Reset Type as used on the drain
tank recorders is used as an example.

1.l Types of Control Action

Automatic process control functions may be enumerated as follows:
1) On-0ff, 2) Proportional Band (throttling range), 3) Reset

Action, and 4) Derivative Action (rate action). One or more of

these functions may be combined in a single controller to produce a
desired control action, and this action (input to output) may be
reversed as required. Whether these functions are accomplished
manually or automatically will depend upon the frequency of the
process change and the speed and dexterity of the operator.

1.2 Reversal of Control Action

Item 1 of Fig. 2 indicates the desired controller output (V
port) for a given controller input (El port). As shown, for an
increase in element (signal transmitter) pressure there will be a
corresponding increase in controller output pressure. As an example,
this mode known as "direct" action, is desired in the case of the
pressurizer level control. As the level increases it is necessary
to increase the pressure applied to the "air to open' letdown valve
in order to reduce the sure applied to the "air to open' letdown
valve in order to reduce the level. Likewise, the opposite mode
(reverse action) is required to decrease the heater on-time when the

fuel pressure increases.
Approved byéizfiéigkaggrvhkﬂq 8?5}%2
p)

Before describing the control actions, it is necessary to
define an "errcr signal' as that change in relation between the
pen (Ttem 1, Fig. 1, Input Signal) and the setting index (Ttem 3,
Fig. 1).

1.3 ON-OFF

This action may be described as a 100% change in output for an

incremental error signal either positive or negative.

1.4 Proportional Band

Items 2 and 3, Fig. 2, show the proportional band scale and
adjustment 1ever; respectively. Proportional action may be defined
as the change in controller OUTPUT air pressure proportional to the
amplitude of the error signal within the 1limits of the measurement
scale range.

Figure 3 shows graphically the relation between the INPUT signal
and the OUTPUT pressure (valve position, Item 2, Fig. 1), assuming
that the setting index is at 50% scale range and the action of the
controller is "direct." The intersection of the curves at the output
scale midpoint is attributable to the fundamental design of the
proportioning mechanisms.

The 100% curve requires the pen to move over its entire range
to produce a 100% change in output pressure. The 0% curve indicates
that an infinitesimal error signal will produce a 100% change in
output, i.e., on-off control. A study of the 200% curve indicates
that the output pressure will not reach its minimum or maximum even
with a 100% change in pen position. Observe the indicated range of
the letdown valve. With a proportional band setting of >P00%, the
valve would never full close (or open) and with 50% the error signal
need be only 1.5 psi (12.5%) to full close (or open) the valve.

Figure L4 shows the same relationship with the set point at 25%
scale range. Note now, with a proportional band >100%, the valve
would never full close even with the maximum negative error signal of
3 psi (25%).

Figure T indicates schematically the floating disk action of the
controller proportional adjustment. An increasing back pressure on

the nozzle, by closing the air gap, is amplified in the relay for

1IN

Approved bxffﬁ?‘#Wéﬁé%géxhﬂq ' 3H1-3

for final control element operation, and is also fed back to the pro-
portional bellows. A total air gap change of .0006" is sufficient

to produce the 3-15 psi change in output pressure. Assuming the con-
troller to be in equilibrium with 9 psi set and input pressures with

a 100% proportional band setting, the output and proportional

" bellows will be at 9 psi. The balance spring will be exerting a

force equivalent to the 9 psi in the P bellows. If a sudden
pressure increase in M occurs, the nozzle bleed will temporarily

be restricted and the output will increase to meet the demand.
However, the output pressure will increase along the 100% propor-
tional band curve because of the feed back to P which is opposing
the action of M about the fulcrum. A decreasing measurement signal
will likewise cause a decrease in output. Note that if the pro-
portional band setting were 0% any feed back to P would have a very
limited effect on the back pressure at the nozzle. The converse is
true if the band setting were 500%. Reversal of control action is
accomplished by interchanging the signals to the set and measure-
ment bellows.

The proportional band adjustment is made by moving the level
horizontally to the desired point on the scale which‘is graduated
from O to 500, indicating the proportional band width in percentage
range of the recorder scale, Item 4, Fig. 1.

1.5 Reset Action (+ Proportional Band)

Ttems 4 and 5 of Fig. 2 show the reset scale and adjustment
screw, respectively. Reset action may be described as a shift of
the proportional band position with regards to the original set
point and is a function of the elapsed time and amplitude of the
error signal. '

Figure 5 indicates graphically a specific action of the reset
control. Again using the let down valve as an example, assume that
the pﬁmping rate has siowly increased to such a value as to require
the valve to be some 92% open to maintain control and would thus

stabilize the measurement pen at 60% of scale when following the
Approved Tz 3H1-L4

8/4/65

original set point 50% proportional band curve. The addition of
the reset action produces the effect of shifting the proportional
band to such an extent that with the new requirement of valve
position, the measurement pen will remain in alignment with the set
point index. The opposite reset action will occur if the pumping
rate were to decrease. The reset action is not a result of the fact
that the valve requirement is now 92% open, but is a result of the
amplitude of the error signal produced by the pen movement and the
time required for this movement, which in turn produces the new
valve position. If reset action 1s present during startup, while
the measurement pen is at or near 0%, the proportional band will
be shifted until it rests entirely above the 50% set point, and
there will be no control action until the pen reaches set point.
Excessive reset will cause an overshoot of the pen in the opposite
direction. Reset action is considered a slow type action of control
and will have little or no effect on rapid process oscillations.

Figure 8 shows the addition of the reset bellows to the floating
disk mechanism along with the reset capacity tank and restrictor
valve arrangement. The feed point of the reset network is in
parallel with the proportional bellows but its action is in oppo-
sition. Assuming that there exists a pressure balance between the
four bellows, the action may be described as follows for a specific
measurement increase condition; an increase in M pressure will pro-
duce an increased output pressure which will follow the preset
proportional band range but will be shifted to an even greater
output by the RC time controlled increase in pressure in R. The
resulting action of a pressure rise in R will produce the same
proportional band shift as would a decrease of pressure in the set
point bellows S. In some controllers the reset action is not auto-
matic, but once a process is stable, the measurement may be brought
into alignment with the set point by a mechanical adjustment of
the balance spring, shown in Fig. T.

The reset action adjustment screw is rotated CW for maximum

control effect and CCW for minimum to the desired setting on the

[ 1Y
.-

Approved b@)@ ' . ?b,Hl/éB
p)

rotating scale which is graduated from .1 to 50, indicating the
reset time constant in minutes. With a setting of .1 minutes (re-
strictor valve full open), the reset bellows will essentially cancel
out the action of the proportional bellows, and the control will

be on-off.

1.6 Derivative Action (+ Proportional Band)

Ttems 6 and 7 of Fig. 2 show the derivative scale and adjustment
screw, respectively. Derivative action may be described as an
automatic proportional band range adjustment which temporarily
narrows the band and depends upon the rate of change of the error
signal. This action may also be considered as maintaining a linear
relationship between the first derivative of the error signal and
the output signal.

Figure 6 shows graphically a transient condition for a specific
derivative action. The 200% proportional band setting is chosen
to show more clearly the resulting action when considering the
letdown valve. If a positive error signal of 5% were to arise as
a result of an increase 1n measurement, the valve would only open
some 2% along the 200% curve with no derivative action. Introduction
of the derivative action produces a fast response narrowing of the
proportional band to some temporary range, which in this case will
open the valve wide (+ 12 psi output), thus attempting to restore
the process to normal by fast letdown before the error signal
becomes excesgive. The derivative control is sometimes called
"anticipatory control.” A loss of measurement signal will cause
a like narrowing of the proportional band in an attempt to close
the valve rapidly.

The above description concerns only "direct" derivative action
which ismost often used with a relatively long process lag, and which
allows the use of a wider proportional band for stability and still
retains the advantage of narrow band control for sudden process
upsets. ''Inverse" derivative has the opposite action in that it

automatically widens the throttling band in proportion to the rate
Approved by Wwff woy 3H1-6

8/k4/65

of change of the error signal. It is most often used in a short
time-constant process in allowing narrow proportional band action
for good control and wide band action for stability.

The derivative action adjustment screw is rotated CCW for maxi-
mum control effect and CW for minimum to the desired setting on the
rotating scale which is graduated from .1 to 50, indicating the
derivative time constant in minutes. A setting of 50 will introduce
such a long time lag into the proportional bellows that the control
action will be essentially on-off.

Note that the error signals do not achieve the magnitude as
depicted graphically in Figs. 5 and 6, but are limited immediately
by the reset action sensing the amplitude and elapsed time and de-
rivative action sensing the rate of change.

1.7 Foxboro Hyper-Reset Control Adjustment Procedure

1) Adjust the reset time to its maximum value and the deriva-
tive time to its minimum value.

2) Set the proportional band at some high value (+ 100%)
and then reduce it in successive steps, leaving the pointer at
each setting long enough to observe the resulting control. Continue
to reduce the proportional hand until cyeling is Jjust perceptible.

3) 1Increase the derivative time until this cycling is removed.
Narrow the proportional band slightly, and again increase the de-
rivative time until cycling is removed. Repeat until further in-
crease of derivative time fails to eliminate the cycling introduced
by the narrowing of the proportional band. Maintain this setting
of derivative time and widen the proportiocnal band until the cycling
is removed.

L) Set the reset time to the same value as the derivative time.

For controllers with reset only, follow steps (1) and (2) but -
leave the proportional band position in a stable and not a cycling
condition. Then reduce the reset time in steps, watching the error
signal decrease to zero. Too much reset will cause a cycling

action, and therefore should be set above this value.

1.8 Frequency Response

Figure 10 shows graphically the theoretical frequency response
of a typical controller., Curve "A" indicates the gain vs frequency
of a proportional controller with a proportional band setting of
100%. The gain will be linear with frequency up to about 100 cycles/
min. Curve "B" indicates the theoretical response of a proportional
+ reset + derivative controller with a proportional band setting
of 50%, a reset time of .1 min and a derivative time of .0l min.

The actual curve "C'" follows the general slope of the reset and
derivative, but changes slope about the intersecting time-constant
points and follows the proportional band. The roll-off at high
frequencies is a function of the limiting mechanical components

of the controller.

Curve "A" of Fig. 11 shows the phase angle vs the frequency of
a proportional controller. As would be expected, the output lags
the input at the higher frequencies due to mechanical limitations.
Curve "B" is a typical theoretical phase shift curve with a reset
time of .1 min and a derivative time of .0l min. Curve '"C" is a
more likely actual phase shift picture in that the change of slope
is not as sharply defined. The change in slope at the higher
frequencies will finally achieve a 180° phase shift which will induce
a positive feedback oscillation in the controller.

The response and phase shift curves shown here are, of course,
for a controller only. In order to obtain a complete picture of
automatic process control action, it is necessary to have the ampli-
tude and phase characteristics of the process system, as well as

the established response of the controller.

2 SCANNER

The scanner system, made up of five "scanners," provides alarm moni-

toring and readout for groups of thermocouples. The system consists of

rotating mercury switches through which combinations of thermocouples

are compared with a reference thermocouple and read out on an oscilloscope.

The block diagram, figure 3Hz-1 shows the various components of this sys-
tem and thelr relationship to each other. ‘

Since portions of the salt system must remain heated at all times,
the scanners will be in continuous operation except for necessary shut-
downs for repairs. Due to the many possible operating conditions of the
salt system, considerable flexibility was built into the scanners which
allow easy changing of inputs. Whenever a portion of the salt system
is cooled, the associated thermocouple signals should be removed from
the scanner so that the alarm feature will not be inactivated. It is
necessary that all points on all operating scanners be connected to a
thermocouple or millivolt signal. Noise from a disconnected point can
completely saturate the amplifier and make the channel inoperable and
can damage the amplifier. When changes of input are made, these should
be logged in both sections of the thermocouple log.showing swinglink
connections, multipoint connections, etc. (See details below.)

The spare to the reference thermocouple for scanners A, B, and C
should always be connected to a temperature recorder and point 100 on
each scanner should be jumpered at the scanner panel to the reference
thermocouple. The scanner gain should always be set as high as possible
to increase the readability of temperatures and narrow the range in which
an alarm will occur. After heatup the gain can usually be set at 100
which will give a reading of 5OOF per inch and will alarm at * 15OOF
from the reference.

The reference signal for scanner D and E will be from a potentio-
meter located at the scanner panel. During heatup this is varied by a
vernastat knob, and the equivalent temperature in °F can be read out
from the vernastat setting. During coolant salt circulation, the switch
should be in the position to give a constant 11.00°F input signal. The
gain should be set at 100 (50°F per inch).
Approved by %—‘ o 3I612é2
-26-65

An alarm should occur at 950°F and 1250°F.

Periodic calibrations should be made of each scanner to assure that
there has been no change in the gain or vertical size of the scope. This
is accomplished by plugging a known EMF signal into a point of the scan-
ner and comparing it with the reference as indicated by point 100. The
vertical multiplier on the scope and the fine gain on the differential
amplifier should be adjusted to alarm at £ 3 inches from the reference

line on any gain setting and indicate on the scope as follows:

Gain OF/inch

25 200
50 100
100 50
250 20

In order to increase the life of the mercury jet scanning switch,

a continuous purge of nitrogen should be maintained as indicated on the
building log.

There are only a few adjustments.of the scanners necessary for rou-
tine operations. These are: dc amplifier, course gain, oscilloscope
vertical and horizontal position, focus, brightness and point locator.

The thermocouple input to the scanner system is from 314 plug-ins
on pyrometer panels#l and#8, and 120 coolant cell thermocouples which
are permanently tied into the scanner system. The 314 pyrometer panel
plug-ins provide an input of 300 thermocouples, 9 duplicated thermocouples,
and 5 reference thermocouples. The following is a detailed description
of each component of the scamner (see figure 3HZ-1 and drawings D-HH-B-41658,
D-HH-B-41659, D-HH-B-41660, D-HH-B-41661, D-HH-B-41662, E-HH-B-41663,
E-HH-B-41664, E-HA-B-41665, E-HH-B-L1666).

2.1 909 thermocouples terminate with plug-in receptacles at "thermo-

couple jack panel#" located in the auxiliary control room on
the 852 level. Hand plug-in leads are used to continue all of

these thermocouples to the scanner system.

"Pyrometer panels ¥l and #2," also located on the 852 level
Just below the thermocouple jack panel, provide 300 scannef\
input receptacles, 100 each to scanners A, B, and C, to receive
hand plug-in leads from the "thermocouple jack panel." A ther-
mocouple log is necessary at the pyrometer panel.

"Thermocouple scanner panel #1" is located on the 840 level

Just southeast of column C-3. The thermocouple leads from the

pyrometer panel route to the "thermocouple scanner panel #1."

The following is the sequence circuit routing of the leads and

a description of the components within the "thermocouple scan-

ner panel #."

2.3.1 The 300 thermocouple leads enter the "scanner panel 4"
by connection to three terminal strips with "swing links."
See table 3Hz-1 for lead identification on the terminal
strips.

A terminal strip is a strip of insulation through which
two parallel rows of screw terminals have been mounted and
which will accommodate 103 leads. Swing links are metal
bars which permit circuit continuity between terminal strip
terminals. Normally the thermocouple leads connect to
one row of screw terminals and continue the circuilt by
the "swing links" across the terminal strip to the other
row of screw terminals. There are 300 leads leaving the
three terminal strips which provide circuitry to the remain-
der of the scanner system. The "swing links" can be rotated
90 degrees in order to couple the scanner terminals together,
thus paralleling two or more of the scanner leads on a given
terminal strip. A thermocouple log is necessary at the
terminal strip.

The "swing link" terminal strips are constructed as shown
on drawing E-HH-B-41663, "detail B." The swing link con-
ductor bars are held in place by the terminal nuts, tThus

requiring a tool to rearrange them.

2.3.2 The 300 scanner leads from the terminal strips are then
routed to twelve 50-point connector receptacles to form
group connectors accommodating 25 leads each.

The connector receptacles are the polarized multipoint
type, and are rectangular in shape. Two rows of 25 con-
nector points make up the two major sides of the rectangle
receptacle. The scanner leads are connected to the recept-
acle in sequential order with the plus pole on one side and
the minus pole on the other side. See table 3H2-1 for lead
identification to the 25 lead polarized receptacles.

2.3.3 The circuitry is then continued from the lead polarized
receptacles by means of polarized connector plug-ins to
another group of twelve 50-point connector receptacles as
listed in table 3Hz2-Z2.

2.3.4 Any of the connector plug-ins as listed in table 3H2-2,
"scanner panel #1 25 lead polarized connector plug-in” can
be inserted into the connector receptacles listed in table
3H2-1. It is important to maintain a record of the effects
of any changes made of these plug-ins in both sections of
the thermocouple log.

This second group of receptacles are identical in con-
struction to the ones described in 2.3.2 above, except all
50 points of each receptacle are connected to the same pole
of 50 scanner leads. This segregates the 300 scanner leads
into six 50-pcint receptacles of plus polarity and six 50-
point receptacles of minus polarity. See table 3HZ2-2 for
lead identification to the scarner lead segregated pole
receptacles.

2.3.5 The scanner leads continue by means of the 50-point con-
nector plug-ins to 3 rotating mercury switches of the scan-
ner system. A rotating mercury switch is a device for cyc-
lic switching of the signal from 100 thermocouples. A
mercury stream rotating at 1200 rpm serves as a brush to

perform the switching of each lead at a rate of 20 times

per second. Each rotating mercury switch has two separate
switch sections which are synchronized by the same motor
shaft. This provides switching for both the plus and minus
pole of the thermocouple lead. Both the plus and the minus
switch bank are each lead adapted by two 50-point connector
plug-ins of the rectangular type. §See table 3HZ2-3 for lead
identification to the mercury switch. The connector plug-
ins from the lower section of each rotating mercury switch
are Tor the negatlive pole and the plug-ins from the top
section are for the positive pole. All the connector plug-
ins of table 3HZ2-3 are identical so they can be plugged
into any of the receptacles of table 3HZ-3. It is imper-
ative that the plug-ins of table 3HZ2-3 be oriented such that
polarity and synchronization are not disrupted. This is
done by pairing the even or the odd numbered plug-ins of a
given mercury switch and then plugging into receptacles
listed in table 3HZ2-2 that have been grouped similarily.
It is further necessary to maintain pole continuity by
noting polarity listed in tables 3H2-2 and 3HZ2-3. Any even
or odd numbered pair of plug-ins may be plugged into any
even or odd numbered pair of connector receptacles as long
as the above mentioned paliring and polarity of each has
been complied with.

The mercury switch motors are energized by plugging into
the 120v AC outlets Al5, Bl5, Cl5, D15, E15, located next
to each mercury switch motor on "scanner panel #1." The
mercury switches are purged by nitrogen continuously to
prevent oxidation of the mercury.

The output leads of the mercury switches each route to a sepa-
rate signal bucking network located on scanner panel# 2. The
rotating mercury switch signal is bucked against a reference
thermocouple signal to give a difference signal output. The

difference signal output routes to individual "D.C. gmplifiers.”

The D.C. amplifier outputs each route to an "alarm discrimina-
tion" and also parallel to a selector switch called "selector
scanner."

The "alarm discriminators” and the "selector scanner! switch
are located on "scanner panel #2." "scanner panel 72" is lo-
cated next to "scanner panel #L."

The selected signal from the selector switch is routed to
an oscilloscope. The light beam across the face of the oscil-
loscope made up of 100 incremental steps displays the visual
readout of a scanner within the scanner system. The amplitudes
of the increments represent the temperatures based on a refer-
ence thermocouple. The following is a more detailed descrip-
tion of the "alarm discriminator," D.C. amplifier, and the
oscilloscope.

2.4.1 The "alarm discriminators" of "scanners A, B, C, D,

and E" are located on "scanner panel #2."

An "glarm discriminator" is an electronic device for
triggering an alarm if the temperature difference between

a reference thermocouple and a thermocouple exceeds a pre-

set limit. This limit is preset by adjusting the "amplifier

gain" knob of the "D.C. amplifier.” It should be noted
that false alarm will occur for a given scanner if there

is not full circuit input to the mercury rotating switch.

The alarm discriminators have individual scanner annun-
ciators located in "scamner panel #L" on the 840'level.

The annunciation is by individual light indicators and a

common alarm. An acknowledgement button is provided on

"scanner panel #2" to silence the alarm, but the light

indicator remains on until the out-of-limit temperature

is corrected.

A Scanner System annunciator is provided in the main
control panel on the 852'level. This provides a general
alarm and general light indication at the main control

panel on the 852' level for an out-of-limit thermocouple

within the scanner system. This annunciator is also pro-
vided with an acknowledgement button to silence the alarm
which is located on the main control console on the 852
level.

2.4.2 The "D.C. amplifiers,"” located on 'scanner panel #2,"
amplify the difference signal from the "alarm discrimina-

t

tors.” The oscilloscope readout is calibrated by adjust-
ing the "amplier gain" knobs on the "differential D.C.
amplifiers" and the vertical multiplier on the oscilloscope
to give the beam amplitude corresponding to a Known ther-
mocouple input to the scanner system. Adjustment should

be as follows:

Oscilloscope Scanner
Gain Reading Alarm
(°F/in) (°F)
25 200 + 600
50 100 + 300
100 50 + 150
250 20 * 60

2.4.3 There are two oscilloscopes within the scanner system;
one on the 840'level at scanner panel #2, and the other is
on the 852'level in the main control panel. The oscillo~
scope on the 840 level is a console unit and plugs into the
two receptacles on "scanner panel.#z." The oscilloscope
on the 852' level is mounted in the main control panel.
Both oscilloscopes are provided with a "thermocouple iden-
tification marker." This is controlled from the 8LO' level
and can be used on the 852' level oscilloscope only when
both oscilloscopes are set on the same scanner position.

The six (6) control knobs located on the front of the
oscilloscope to control the display of the light beam are

as follows:

2.4.3.1 '"Vertical adjustment'--used to move display up or
down for centering reference line.

2.4.3.2 Horizontal adjustment--used to move display to
either side for centering.

2.4.3.3 Focus adjustment--used to adjust the display to
maximum sharpness.

2.4k.3.4 Intensity--used to vary the light intensity of
the display. This should be maintained at a good low
intensity to minimize burning the cathod ray tube
phosphorescent coating.

. 2.4.3.5 Thermocouple identification marker--the "thermo-

couple identification marker" serves to identify the

incremental section of light beam on the oscilloscope

corresponding to each of the programmed input thermo-

couples. The marker is a dot of light that appears

just in the increment in question. The position of

the marker dot is identified and controlled by a heli-

pot selector switch called "thermocouple identifica-

tion marker." The switch indicates the positions

. from 1 to 100, position 1 is the extreme left incre-

ment on the face of the oscilloscope and position 100

- is the extreme right increment on the face of the
oscilloscope.

2.4k.3.6 Light beam amplitude control--normally this con-
trol is set to read a full scale amplitude with an
input signal of £ 1 volt. This contrel is used when
it is desired to change the calibration of the scope
without changing the alarm calibration. (Refer to
alarm discriminator for alarm calibration, section

2.4.2).

2.5 Reference thermocouples are thermocouples that have a known
) readout and are introduced into the scanner system to provide
a datum temperature. Thermocouples are then readout by com-

parison with a reference thermocouple.

Each scanner has an input receptacle for a reference ther-
mocouple..at the "pyrometer panel." The circuitry of the ref-
erence thermocouple lead routes from the pyrometer panel to
a terminal strip in "scanner panel #." Then the reference
thermocouple lead continues to the signal hucking network where
the signal is bucked against the analytical thermocouples sig-
nal as previously described.

The reference thermocouple input can be simulated with an
external electronic source and coupled into the scanner system
at the pyrometer panel.

Table 3H2-4 details the routing of the reference thermo-
couple leads within the scanner system.

The scanner system has designed within circiutry that permits
single input thermocouple signal to be read out on 25 consecu-
tive increments of the oscilloscope display. This permits a
more accurate examination of an individual thermocouple. Again
it should be noted that false alarm will occur if the 100 points
of a given scanner are not activated. Signal input can be
either four (4) 25 duplicated thermocouple inputs or 100 single
thermocouple inputs, or any combination thereof.

There are nine duplicated thermocouple input receptacles
on the pyrometer panel as listed in table 3H2-5; 3 each to
scanners #, B, and C.

The thermocouples to be read out on the duplicated scanner
are introduced at the pyrometer panel by jumper leads from the
"patch panel" as previously described. The leads from the
pyrometer panel then proceed to the terminal strips with swing
links in "scanner panel #1."

The swing links permit the paralleling of duplicated leads
at the terminal strips.

The leads then continue from the terminal strips of "scan-
ner panel #1" to the nine 25-point connector receptacle of
"scanner panel #1." Each lead connects to all 25 points of a

connector receptacle.

The connector receptacles are identical to the others pre-
viously described so any scanner connector plug-in can be cou-
pled into them. Table 3Hz-5 details the circuitry of the dupli-
cated thermocouple facility.

The radiator temperature control is of crucial importance so
scanners D and E are semi-permanently connected to 120 radiator
thermocouples.

The thermocouple circuitry of scanners D and E is similar
to that of scanners A, B, and C except that the 120 thermocou-
ples couple directly into the terminal strips on "scanner panel
#1" of scanner D and E.

Scanners D and E each readout 60 thermocouples, the first
4O of which are duplicated to activate all 100 points of the
scanner.

The thermocouple leads route from their origin within the
radiator section of the project to two terminal strips in "scan-
ner panel #1." A parallel lead for each thermocouple also
routes to the "patch panel" to provide duplicate readout. The
terminal strips are equipped with swing link conductors so
that one thermocouple lead can be paralleled into more than
one scanner readout circuit within a given terminal strip.

When swing lengths are used, sections of the thermocouple log
should be corrected to indicate this.

The leads continue within the "scanner panel #1" from the
terminal strip in sequence to eight 50-point pole segregated
connector receptacles which are the same rectangular type that
was explained in Section 2.3.2. The leads are pole segregated
into four 50-point plus pole and four 50-point negative pole
receptacles. Table 3H2-6 details routing of the radiator
thermocouple'leads within the scanner system.

Scanner mercury switches D and E "located on scanner panel
#1" are plugged in at this point and are identical as described
in Section 2.3.5. Again it is emphasized that the mercury

switch connector plug-ins be paired by even or odd numbers and

3H INSTRUMENTATION

3. COMFUTER

The operation of the computer for collecting, recording, and pro-
cessing reactor data is largely automatic and will require 1ittler-
attention, However, there are a few functions that must be perfofmed
by the reactor operators on a routine basis to keep the computer system
operating properly under normal conditions. In addltion, special
operator actlons are required when computer failures occur.

° A large amount of published information is availlable which describes
the computer and its operation at all technical levels. The principal
documents and their general contents on these subjects are listed
below for reference.

1) MSRE Design and Operations Report, Part II, Nuclear and
Process Instrumentation, by J. R. Tallackson, ORNL-TM-729.
Thils document contains a description of the hardware and
the system capability, along with information concerning its
use on the MSRE.

2) MSRE Reactor Operators' Computer Manual, by C. D. Martin, et al.
This contains all the information normally required by reactor
operations personnel to make full use of the computer. Be-
cause of its bulk and specific applicability, this document

- 1s separated from the rest of the reactor operating manual.

Since the signal tabulations and other detailg within the
computer are subject to change, an up-to-date copy of this

" report 1s kept at the computer console,

3) MSRE Computer System Report, by C. D. Martin, et al, This
report 1s a complete description of the application of the
computer to the MSRE. It includes engilheering descriptions
of the calculatlons as well as computer flow charts and
progrem listings,

4)  BR-340 System Marnual, supplied by Bunker-Remo Corporation. This

L is a highly detailed description of the entire 340 computer
system. It is intended for use primarily by the computer

programmers and maintenance personnel,

Sinee there is a separate opervating menual for the computer {Com-
puter Manusl, item 2 above), the purpose of this part of the reactor
operators! manual is to emphasize those functions that must be performed

routihely.

Tog Forms

The routine-logs typéwriter, Typer No. 2, uses & pre-
printed form which is completed each shift. The £irst infor-
mation 1s typed on this form 15 minutes after the start of a
shift and the laet informmiion appears about 15 mirutes before
the emd of the shift. A new form must be inserted in this
typer shortly after the staxt or shortly before the end of each
shift. Detailed ingtruetions for inserting and aligning the
Porms are glven in the Computer Mamal. |
Calendar Date

Although the computer containg an internal deviece for

generating elock time, there i1g no proviglon for ealeulating
the calendar date. BSilnce the computer makes freguent use of
the date in storing date, this information must be mpnuelly
entered each day shortly after midnight, Detailed instructions
for entering "Dnte" are givem in the Computer Mamual,

The calendsr date in the computer is typed automatiesally
as part of the routine logs on Typer No. 2. Tt is NOT typed
ankomatically by the other 3 typers. Therefore, the procedure
for typing the date on each of Typers Na, 1, 3, and 4 must
be executed nesr the beginning of each ghift. This procedure
15 detalled in the Computer Menual.

Magnetie Tape

During normal operation, the computer will store data
on ‘the m&gmetid tape on one of the two dpive units; the second
unit will be in standby with a full reel of blank tape. When
the first reel is filled, the computer will mutomatically
switeh to the standby unit and armounce the fect on Typer No. 1.
When this occurs, a reactor operator will rewind the completed
tape and replace it with enother reel of blank tape.

Geeaslonally 1% will be éeairable to remove a tape before it
ig completely filled. On these oecasions; the operator will
manually switch to the sgtandby unit before rewinding and
removing the "in-use" reel. Detailed procedures for switch-
ing tape units and for rewinding and changing tape reels
are glven in the Camputer'Manualf‘ The handling and storage
of new and completed magnetic tapes is deseribed in 12D of
this manual,
Computer Failure

There sre two areas which will require special attention
in the event of & fallure of the computer. Thege are {1) the
continued operation of the reagtor system without dats from the

N
[

computer and {2} the restoration of computer operation.

When the computer is out of* serviee, 1t will be necessary
to colleet a large amount of data manually in order to main-
tain adequate survelllance of the reactor systems. The
changes in resctor operation for this condition are desceribed
in 6G of thils mehual,

Restouration of computer operation will usually require
the attention of & programmer (ORNL) and/or a computer
maintenence engineer (Bunker-Ramo). Once the computer is
again operational, the way in which it is put in service de-
pendg on the condition of the reactor system and the duration
of the outage. If no power change has occurred during the
owtage and the down time is less than 30 minutes, all the com-

puter functions will be reactivated. TIf the reactor was in

"steaﬂy state with regard to xenon and samarium transients

prior to ‘the outage and no power changes occurred, all the com-
pﬁter funetions will be reactivated even if the down time is
greater than 30 minutes, Tf a xenon or samarium transient

was in progress prior to an outage of morve than 30 minutes or

lif'a power change occurred, only part of the computer functions

will be activated. The notable exception in this case is the
Approved. 'b,'y‘/f%> b%g 2 1L | H3-4
| Vo 8/3 30/65

the reactivity balance which must be corrected for changes
during the outage. The details of restarting the computer
under various circumstances are described in the Computer

Manual.

3.5 Procedure.for Changes

One of the feétures which makes the computer so useful is
its flexibiiity, Changes can be made in the form of calcu-
lations, thé coné%ants which are used, the form of output, and
so on, to meet the changing needs of reactor operations and
analysis or to improve the performance of the computer.
Changes in such a complex system must be handled carefully,
however. It is imperative that proposed changes be reviewed
thoroughly before they are made and that changes be properly
documented when they are made. To this end the following
procedures will be adhered to.

Recommendations for changes will normally originate within
the MSRE Operations Department, in either the operations
group, the analysis group or the computer group. Any recom-
mended change will be described by the person originating it
on a Change Request Form. Changes originating in the opera-
tions group must be approved by the Operations Chief or Assistant
Operations Chief. The head of the nuclear.and mechanical
analysis group, J. R. Engel, will evaluate and screen recom-
mended changes and will coordinate computer changes and reactor
operation. All changes must be approved by Engel and by the
head of the MSRE Operations Department. The computer group
will advise on the amount of effort involved in proposed
changes aﬁd will make those changes which have been approved.

Requests originating in the operations group will go first
to the Operations Chief (or Assistant Operations Chief). If
he considers the change desirable, he will forward the request
to Engel. Requests originating in the Analysis group will
go directly to Engel. After he has evaluated the usefulness

and desirability of any requested change from the standpoint
Approved by A7 iy se m 3H3-5
" 4 8/30/65
- of operations and analysis, Engel may return a request to the
originator with an explanation of why it should not be made.
Other requests he will pass on to the computer group for an
estimate of the effort required to maké the change. Recom-
mendations for changes may be originated in the computer
- group. These will generally be of such a nature as to make
more efficient use of the computer or to improve the accuracy
of a particular calculation. They will submit their recom-
mended changes with an estimate of the effort and improvement
to Engel. After receiving an estimaté from the computer
group, Engel will evaluate the utility and cost of the change.
If he decides the change is not worthwhile, he will file the
Change Request, the estimate of effort, and pertinent notes
and will notify the originator. If he approves the change,
it will go to the department head for approval. If he approves
the change, it will be sent to the computer group for action.
Upon receiving an approved Change Request, the computer
group will proceed as follows:
1. Program the recommended change if applicable. If the
change involves only altering a constant or similar word

> in the computer skip steps 2 and 3.

2. Assemble/compile the program on line and execute through

- On~Line Program Development.

3. Completely de-bug the program exercising all program
options and check for correct answers.

- L, Advise J. R. Engel when the change is ready for inclusion
in the system and inform him of the amount of time the
computer will have to be off line to incorporate the
change.

5. Engel will give the go-ahead to take the computer off
line to make the change or he will advise to wait until
the next scheduled reactor shut-down or computer routine

! maintenance shut-down to make the change.

6. Make the change when advised by Engel.
Approved bygﬁﬁgﬂ%gz;tfﬁzzmx 3H3-6
4 8/30/65
T. Correct the master cop& of the Reactor Operator's Com-
puter Manual (on computer.console) to reflect the change.
8. Enter time, date, and nature of the change in the computer
log and the reactor log.
9. Enter the change in the master copy of the Computer
System Report and list on the running list of changes to
the computer system report for periodic publication.
10. Notify operations and the analysis group of the fact that

the change has been made in the system.

There are certain constants (thermocouple bias corrections)
which may vary from time to time requiring changes in the A
conversion-equation table code words to reflect the current
bias. Certain other constants of similar nature may also need
to be changed from time to time. Minor changes of this type
will be verbally referred to J. R. Engel (if not originated
by him) for approval to make the changes without following
the above procedure. The only documentation required is that
outlined in steps 7, 8, and 9 above.

If there 1s any doubt as to whether a change may be
made following the abbreviated procedure, J. R. Engel will

decide which procedure is to be used.

3HL ANNUNCIATORS

Visible and/or audible annunciators are provided to alert the
operator when any of the important parameters are out of the prescribed
limits.

In general, when a variable deviates from the normal value, an
alarm first occurs on the computer and its value is typed on the alarm
typewriter. If the variable deviates further from the normal, a con-
ventional alarm will occur which will be indicated by a light above the
main beoard and an audible signal. If the variable deviates still further,
control action will occur.

There are fifteen different types or combinations of annunciators
at the MSRE., These are outlined in Table 3 HA4-1 and Fig. 3H4-1 and
described in the following pages.
| Table 3IH4-2 is a list of each annunciator. The cause of the annun-
ciation is described, the automatic control actions which are initiated
by the condition causing the annunciation are enumerated and suggested
remedial actions to be taken by the operator are given. Table 3HL-3
gives similar information for the Electro-system Temperature switches
and alarms. It should be emphasized that the suggested operator action
does not always apply. Consideration should be given to the condition
of the system, what tests are in progress, and other pertinent information.

Table 3IHL-L describes the various audible alarms.

4.1 Type I - Annunciations coming Direct to the Control Room

These may contain one or more switches in series or parallel
which will actuate the system. During normal operation the
red and white lights above the main control board will be on
dim indicating that the bulbs are good. There will be no
audible alarm.,

When a sustained abnormal condition occurs there will be
an audible alarm in the main control room and the associated
red and white lights above the main board will be on bright.

Pushing the acknowledge button on the console will turn off

the white light and audible signal. The red light will remain
on. If the condition clears the red light will go off and the
white light will come on.. If the condition reoccurs the
lights will come on bright and there will be an audible signal.
If the reset button on the console is pushed before the con-
dition reoccurs, the white light will go off.

Type II - Annunciators coming direct to the Auxiliary Control

Boards with no Common Visual Alarm on the Main Control Board.

These may contain one or more switches in series or parallel
which will actuate the system. During normal operation the
white lights above the auxiliary control board will be off and
there will be no audible alarm.

When an abnormal condition occurs there will be an audible
alarm in the auxiliary control room. Both of the white lights
above the auxiliary control board will be flashing. Pushing
the acknowledge button on the auxiliary control board will turn
off the:'flasher and audible signals. Both white lights will
remain on if the abnormal condition is sustained. If the con-
dition clears both of the white lights will go off. If the con-
dition reoccurs the lights will flash and there will be an
audible signal.

The lamp test button will turn all lights on to periodi-
cally test that they are operable,

Type ITT Annunciators Coming Direct. to the Auxiliary Control

Board with a Common Visual Alarm on the Main Control Board.

These may contain one or more switches in series or parallel
which actuate the system on the sampler panel or on the auxiliary
control board. Any one of several alarms will annunciate on a
common annunciator in the main-control room. During normal
operation the white lights above the suxiliary-control board
will be off and the red and white lights above the main-control

will be on dim indicating that the bulbs are good. There will

Tvpe IV Annunciators Coming Direct to the Sampler, Scanner,

Vapor Condensing System, or Chemical Processing Panel with a

Common Visual Alarm on the Main Control Board.

These may contain one or more switches in series or paral-
lel which actuate the system on the sampler, scanner, vapor con-
densing system, or chemical processing panel. Any one of
several alarms will annunciate on a common annunciator in the
main control room. During normal operation the red and white
lights above the local panel, main control board will be on
dim indicating that the bulbs are good. There will be no audi-
ble alarm.

If, at any time after the sampler, scanner, vapor condensing
system, or chemical processing board acknowledge button has
been pushed, the condition clears and reoccurs or another ab-
normal condition occurs the red and white lights will come
on and there will be an audible sighal in both the main control
room and at the local panel. After acknowledgment and when
the condition has cleared, pushing the reset button on the
local panel will clear the white light.

The vapor condensing panel differes from the others in
that it has a test button which, when pushed, will cause an
annunciation in the MCR.

4.5 Type V - VIT Annunciators Coming Through The Auxiliary Control

Room Temperature Modules

A number of temperature signals are connected to Electro
System temperature switches. These are used to initiate annunci-
ations or in some cases are in control circuits. The power sup-
ply switch should be on at all times as indicated by the amber
light at the upper left hand corner. The manuval-~auto switch at
the right hand side of the panel should be in the manual posi-
tion. Some power supply panels have red lights, the red light
will go on when an associated alarm module is actuated. All
power supplies have reset buttons. Some not needed for present

assignment of modules but would be needed if an alarm module

9/2k/65
(Type ET-L200) were added. There are several variations in the
way that this alarm system operates. These are described
below:

With the exception of TS FD-1-19B and TS FD-2-19B which
do not alarm, the operation of TX-3001L and TS-AD3-5B and AD3-TB
is as follows:

Type V

During normal operation the power supply amber light is on
and the red (alarm) light is off. The red lights on the modules
are on dim. When an abnormal condition occurs there will be
an audible alarm in the main control room and the associated
red and white lights above the main bhoard will be on bright.
The red light on the power supply and the red light on the
module will be on bright. Pushing the acknowledge button on
the console will turn off the white light and audible signal in
the main control room. The red light on the main control board
will remain on and the lights in the auxiliary control room will
not change. If another abnormal condition occurs, the associ-
ated module light will come on but there will be no audible or
visual alarm in the main control room. When the abnormal con-
dition clears, nothing will happen. Pushing the reset on the
power supply will turn off the red lights on the module and
switch from red to amber on the power supply. The red light
on the main board will go off and the white light will be on..
Pushing the reset on the console will clear the main board.
Type VI

With the exception of TS FD-1-20B and TS FD-2-20B which do
not alarm, the operation of TX-3002 1s as follows:

During normal operation the module red lights are on dim.
When an abnormal condition occurs there will be an audible
alarm in the main control room and auxiliary control room. The
associated red and white lights above the main control board
will be on bright and white lights above the auxiliary control
board will be flashing. The red light on the module will be

on. Pushing the acknowledge button on the console will turn off
Approved by 7 7% e‘td/ dduly 3HL-6
-V R 9/2k/65

the white light and audible signal in the main control room.
The red light on the main control board and the audible alarm
and flashing lights and module red lights in the auxiliary con-
trol room will remain on. Pushing the acknowledge button in
the auxiliary control room will turn off the flasher and audi-
ble signal but will leave the white light above the auxiliary
board and red module light on. The associated main control
board light will change from red to white. Pushing the reset
button on the console will clear the main board. If another
abnormal condition occurs on TX-3002 or if the condition clears
and reoccurs, or if an abnormal condition occurs on TX-3002
and an obnormal condition already exists (for that particular
FV) on TX-3003 through TX-3010, the associated module light
will come on but there will be no audible or visual alarm in
the main control room.

When the abnormal conditions clear nothing will happen.
Pushing the reset on the power supply after the abnormal con-
dition has cleared will turn off the red lights on the module
and turn off the white light above the auxiliary control board.
Type VIT

The remaining Klectro System temperature switches are as-
sociated with freeze valves. Kach temperature module has 2
lights. A Dbright amber light indicating that the temperature
is in alarm and a green light indicating that the temperature
is normal. Depending on the requested condition of the valve
(frozen or thawed) either light could be on under normal
conditions.

These temperature switch signals are included in an alarm
(and control) circuit and will alarm if the temperature is out-
side the limits set for the selected condition of the freeze
valve. Operation would be as follows:

During normal operation the main control board and auxiliary
control board lights would be off and there would be no audible
annunciation. When an abnormal condition occurs there will be

an audible alarm in the main controcl room and auxiliary control
'/‘ .

’ room. The associated red and white lights above the main con-
trol board will be on bright and the white lights above the
auxiliary control board will be flashing. To determine the
switch module causing the alsrm it will be necessary to con-
sider all associated switches (i.e. all on FV-104) and the
requested condition of this particular freeze valve. Pushing
the acknowledge button on the console will turn off the white
light and audible signal in the main control room. The red
light on the main control board and the audible alarm and
flashing lights in the auxiliary control room will remain on.

Pushing the acknowledge button in the auxiliary control
room will turn off the flasher and audible signal but will
il leave both white lights above the auxiliary board on. The
module lights will not change. Pushing the reset button on
the console will clear the main board. If another abnormal
condition occurs on the same freeze valve there will be no
audible or visual alarm in the main control room. If the alarm
clears the module lights will change and the white light above
the auxiliary control board will go off. Another annunciation
will then give an audible and visual alarm in the main control
roomn.

An alarm on another freeze valve while the initial alarm
condition exists will alarm in the normal manner.

4.6 Type VIIT Annunciators Coming Through Rochester Alarm Substation

Modules
- A number of signals are connected to Rochester substations
modules in the auxiliary control room and have common annunci-
ators in the main control room. Operation of these are as
follows:

During normal operation, the module selector switch should
be in the operate position. The module light will be on. When
an abnormal condition occurs there will be an audible alarm 1in
the main control room and‘the associated red and white lights

, above the main board will be on bright. The light at the module

5 JUMPER BOARD

On the MSRE there are many interlocking features of control circuits

and safety circuits to prevent undesirable and dangerous events from

taking place.

To provide for necessary flexibility under other-than-

normal operating conditions, provisions are made to by-pass certain

interlocks under strict administrative control. The jumper board provides

this flexibility along with a visual indication of the condition of all

circuits represented thereon. The location of the Jjumper board in the

main control room provides both accessibility and ease of administrative

control of any jumpers used.

5.1 Design Criteria, from operations standpoint, are as follows:

5.1.1 Bafety circuit isolation 1s maintained by means of by-

passing relays. Instead of insertion of a Jjumper pin
directly into the circuit, as with non-safety circuits,
the safety jumper pin operates a relay which indirectly

by-passes the circuit function.

5.1.2 The jumper board displays the condition of circuits by

means of indicating lamps. These lamps (white) are placed
between the schematic contacts of the circuits and will
indicate whether the circuit to this point is energized

or de-energized. A brief notation of the condition re-
quired to energize the circuit is given at each schematic

contact.

5.1.3 All jumper board safety circults are designed so that

failures of jumper board components will not jeopardize
operation of the circuits. The indicator lamps described
above are connected with diodes in series so that current
cannot "back feed" through the lamps to maintain a circuit.
For further information on the hookup of these diodes

(or check valves) see the maintenance elementary drawings
of jumper board safety circuits. Note that all circuits

are not thus provided.

5.1.4 Jumper pin openings in safety circuits are distinguished

by their red color. The presence of a safety system (red)
A

. —~ 8/6/65

5.1.4 (continued)
jumper is annunciated (MB-10, XA L4008-1) and also will
prevent entry into "operate' mode. If system is already
in "operate” mode, the insertion of a safety jumper will
cause system to go to "off." Other jumpers (block openings)
will not give an annunciation when inserted.

5.2 Use of Jumper Board
5.2.1 Although the jumper board is provided for flexibility

of operation it must be remembered that the use of Jumpers
violates the normal designed operational interlock func-
tions. The use of jumpers is under strict administrative
control. No jumper should be inserted without the per-
mission of the Operations Chief or Operations Department
Head.

5.2.2 To determine the condition of the circuits shown
schematically on the jumper board observe the white lights
located between contacts. The notations at all of the
contacts down to a particular lamp give the conditions
which must be met for the lamp to be on. If all white
lamps in a circuit are on the end condition lamp {(red,
green, or amber) will be on to signify the action or
condition notation at the bottom of the circuit. OSome
circuits give condition when de-energized — e.g. circuits
20 and 21 indicate fill restrict condition when de-ener-
gized. The color of indicating lamps is also of signifi-
cance. During power operation in RUN mode all RED lights
will be OFF, all GREEN lights will be ON, the AMBER
lights may be ON or OFF as required.

5.3 Other information displayed on the jumper board involves freeze
valves and instrument power circuits.

5.3.1 The freeze valve permissive lights on the lower jumper
board C#h) give indication of system conditions which would
allow thawing of the particular valve. Note that these
lights do not indicate permission to thaw from the stand-

point of the valve itself — i.e temperature of pot or

shoulders. For example — a permissive light on Jjumper
board for fill valves (FV-104, FV-105, FV-106) requires
that all transfer freeze valves be frozen and the AP
between tank and the FP be low. For a permissive light on
transfer valves requires that all fill valves be frozen,
the tank pressure low, and the reactor system be empty of
salt. For details on FV permissive lights see block
diagram D-HH-B-57331 or circuit diagrams for the individual
freeze valves.

2 The IPP (instrument power) lights on the lower board (#4)
indicate whether or not power is available to certain
circuits in IPP-1, IPP-2, and IPP-4. See Table 3H5.1

for listing of these circuits and what is supplied by them.
For details on these and other instrument power circuits

see Drawing E-HH-Z-41695.

6 OTHER INSTRUMENTS
6.1 Fql-569-A, Reactor Cell Air Bleed Line Flow Totalizer (Wet Test
Meter)

This instrument will be used to measure the amount of reactor

cell and drain-tank cell in-leakage by bleeding it off to the
containment stack. It is connected in parallel with line 565
which connects the component coolant pump discharge to the con-
tainment stack inlet. After the reactor and drain-tank cells
have been brought to the desired operating pressure, HV-565-C
will be closed and flow established through FgI-565-A to main-
tain the contaimment cell pressure within proper limits.

The instrument is an American Meter Controls, Inc. standard
precision,positive displacement, wet test meter with a capacity
of 5¢/min.

Tnit. Date/Time

6.1.1 Preparing the meter for use:
6.1.1.1 Level the meter by adjusting
the leveling screws at the base
until the bubble in the spirit
level 1s exactly in the center.
6.1.1.2 Fill the meter with distilled

water until the water level is
slightly above the tip of the

pointer in the gage glass.

6.1.1.3 Make sure all connections are
tight.
6.1.1.4 After the reactor cell leak

rate has been determined, open
HV-569-A  and HV-569-B

and close HV-565-C __ . Throttle
HV-569-B until the flow rate through
rotameter FI-569 is equal to the
Approved bx,422¢523f<ﬁ%;¢£n¢n /iﬁ?éz

Init. Date/Time

6.1.1.4 (continued)
cell leak rate plus the cell nitro-
gen-purge rate. Cell leak rate
+ cell nitrogen-purge rate
= £/m through FI-569.

Pass the gas to be measured through

the wet test meter until the water
is saturated. At normal rates of
flow and room temperature, the
approximate time required is one
hour for a meter in which the

water or gas has been changed.

6.1.1.5 Disconnect the tubing leading
to the meter so that both inlet
and outlet are under atmospheric
pressure. Draw off water through
the small pet cock at the base of
the water line gage until the
center of the concave meniscus in
the gage glass coincides exactly
with the tip of the pointer. Usu-
ally this may best be accomplished
by viewing the pointer through a
magnifying glass from below with
the aid of a flashlight, if neces-
sary. The image of the pointer
will be visible on the underside
of the meniscus and the tip of
the image should just touch the
tip of the pointer when suffi-
cient water has been withdrawn.

6.1.1.6 Reconnect the tubing.

6.1.1.7 Place meter in service.

6.1.1.8 For extended runs, the gas enter-
ing the meter should pass through a
saturator to prevent a change of lig-
uid level in the meter during the run.

Fill saturator with distilled water.

6.1.2 Reading the instrument:
6.1.2.1 One revolution on the large dial
is 1 liter. ©Subdivisions are 0.0l
liter. The totalizing dials read
10,000 liters, maximum.

AO,-566-A, Reactor Cell Oxygen Analyzer

The purpose of this instrument will be to monitor the oxy-
gen concentration in the reactor and drain-tank cell atmosphere
and to provide a means for calculating the containment cell
in-leakage. A bypass flow will bé circulated through the ana-
lyzer which is connected in parallel with line 566, the return
line from the reactor cell air-bleed line to the component
ccoling pump suction.

The instrument is a Beckman Instruments, Inc., model F3,
oxygen analyzer that continuously measures oxygen concentration
in gaseous streams based on the magnetic susceptibility of the
gas being analyzed. Two ranges, O to 10% and O to 25% are
provided; and the accuracy is claimed to be * 1% of full scale.

The general formula for calculating the leak rate is taken

from Section 3E 1.2 B(3) of the Operating Procedures:

6.2.1 Operating Controls
The instrument is provided with three operating con-
trols: the Range Switch, the Zero Control, and the Span
Control. The Range Switch sets the zero point of the
scale and the Span Control sets the span point, a reference
point at the opposite end of the scale from the zero point.
The setting to which the operator must turn the Zero Con-
_trol in order to establish a correct zero point (down scale
standardization point) depends on several factors, two of

the most important of which are the particular response
Approved byﬁwg s
~ 9/14/65

6.2.1 (continued)
characteristics of the individual instrument and the mag-
netic susceptibilities of the various background gases in
the sample.

Similarly, the setting to which the operator must turn
the Span Control in order to establish a correct span point
(up scale standardization point) depends on several factors,
of which the one most subject to change is the pressure in
the analysis cell. This pressure can vary because of a
change in elther the pressure at which the incoming sample
enters the instrument or the pressure against which the
outgoing sample is discharged. If both Span and Zero Con-
trol adjustments are to be made, the zero adjustment must
be made first.

6.2.2 Reference Gases

For calibration, the instrument redquires two reference
gases -- a zero gas and a span gas -- each of accurately
known oxygen content.
6.2.2.1 Zero Gas

The terms "zero point” and "zero gas" as applied
to the analyzer, are used in a specialized sense. The

two terms, which relate to the electronic circuitry,

refer to the potential on the suspension. The zero
point is a reference point on that end of the readout
scale which corresponds t0o a potential of zero on the
suspension; the zero gas is a reference gas, the oxy-
gen content of which is such that this gas can be used
to establish the zero point. Note that the term "zero
point” is not synonymous with "zero-percent oxygen
point." Although in some instruments these two points
coincide, in others they do not. In this instrument,
zero voltage on the suspension corresponds to a read-
ing at the low endpoint of the scale.

The zero gas (nitrogen) used with this instrument

6.2.2.2 The Span Gas
The span point is set with a gas having a known
oxygen content. Clean dry air, which contains 20.93%
oxygen, is a convenient span gas; however, the span
gas that will be used was specially made up and ana-
lyzed spectrographically. This gas, which contains
4.82% oxygen, will be used to set the span point of
the analyzer.
6.2.3 Preliminary Procedure
Supply power to the instrument for 24 hours before
standardizing it. This warm-up period 1s necessary because
a reliable calibration can be obtained only after the ana-
lyzer has reached a stable operating temperature. Moreover,
the resultant elevated temperature will help to prevent
moisture from condensing in the analysis cell and damaging
it. After the instrument has reached operating temperature,
run gas through it until the reading ceases to drift.
Ordinarily, approximately one hour will be required.

A-Be-A-AD3, Beryllium Monitors

There will be two beryllium monitors in use, one in the
vent house, and one in the high bay. Although these will be
their normal locations, the monitors can be moved to other
areas if desired. The instrument located in the vent house,
designated the ORNL beryllium monitdr model 1, will be used
to monitor the air in the radiator stack when the reactor is
operating, and the coolant-cell atmosphere during maintenance
periods. This is a spectrographic monitor in which the air
being sampled is drawn through a spark which excites any
beryllium atoms whiéh are present. The resulting ultraviolet
radiation that is emitted is spectrographically analyzed for
the characteristic beryllium wavelength. The beryliium con-
centration in the air is displayed on a strip chart on the

instrument.

The other beryllium monitor, a model Sa-103 made by the

National Spectrographic Laboratory, will normally be used in

the southeast corner of the high bay. Air is drawn into the

unit through

a filter paper tape that moves under the arc of

a spectrograph which analyzes the light emission for the char-

acteristic beryllium wavelength. The beryllium concentration

Cover Gas Oxygen Analyzer

A 100 cc/min. stream of helium cover gas is passed through
a Lockwood and McLorie, Inc. model 0-1000 oxygen analyzer to
determine the oxygen concentration in the cover gas. The
analyzer electrolytically determines the oxygen in the sample
stream by first reducing it according to the equation
Os + 2Hop + 4 e » LOH',
and then measuring the electrolysis current. The amount of
current is directly proportional to the oxygen concentration
in the sample and is indicated on a meter on the instrument.
6.5.1 General Precautions
6.5.1.1 The potassium hydroxide used in the various cells
of the analyzer should be handled carefully. After
the analyzer is in operation, the reagent is in a
pressurized system making the caustic even more
hazardous. Do not disconnect sample lines, cells,
or any fittings in the analyzer without first depres-
surizing the analyzer. Wear goggles or safety glasses
when handling the caustic. Flush with copious
amounts of water any areas of the skin, clothing,

or working spaces accidently brought into contact

been carried out as per the following

instructions, the analyzer can be

switched to the unknown sample gas.

6.5.2.2.1 Make certain drain valve

again levels out.
6.5.2.3 Performance Check

Since under normal operating conditions, the ana-

lyzer performs in accordance with Faraday's law, the
following sensitivities can be expected at 1 atmos-

phere at 2500.

*For samples containing more than 100 ppm Os, the ana-

~lyzer should not be operated at flow rates greater than
150 cc/minute in order to avoid appreciable deviation
from quantitative behavior. On occasion, certaln silver
electrodes may also deviate somewhat from gquantitative
behavior at lower concentrations with flow rates over
200 ce/min. while others will perform well up to 40O

cc/min. In a properly functioning analyzer, all

electrodes exhibit good quantitative behavior up to 200
cc/min. with gases below 100 ppm.
6.5.2.3.1 Span Adjustment

After the recorder has leveled out, the span
may be adjusted in accordance with the above sen-
sitivities.

Mo illustrate, if the flow rate is 100 cc/min.,
the sensitivity of the analyzer will be 26.3 micro-
amps per ppm Os.

With a 5 mv recorder and a desired full scale
range of 20 ppm, the adjustment of the span adjust-
ment pbtentiometer may be calculated as follows.
Substitute in Ohm's Law.

Since the span adjustment potentiometer is

(0.380 x 25 = 9.5) or the resistance required to
give a full scale range of 20 ppm at a flow rate

amounts to about four to six microamps and may be
disregarded except in the most critical applica-
tions.
The zerc or background of the instrument may
be checked as follows:
The method is based on the fact that when
no gas is flowing through the instrument, there
should be no output from the cell. When no gas
is flowing, any reading on the recorder then is
the zero or background of the instrument.

over the vent of the ana-
lyzer or close shut-off

6.5.2.3.2.3 Even through the

there still may be appre-
ciable flow through the
electrode to give a false
zero. Sufficient time
should be allowed for the
pressure to equalize on
both sides of the silver

tions.

6.5.2.3.2.6 Occasionally, after
the zero has been checked
by the no-flow method, the
analyzer will become noisy
when returned to its normal
operating conditions. This
noise can usually be removed
by setting the flow rate to
a maximum for a short period
and then returning it to its

6.6 Cover Gas Moisture Analyzer

A 100 cc/min. stream of helium covergas is passed through
ﬁ Manufacturers Engineering and Equipment Corporation (Meeco)
model W electrolytic moisture analyzer to determine the mois-
ture concentration in the cover gas. The moisture 1s absorbed
from the gas stream flowing through the electrolytic cell and
an electrolytic current is established. This current depends
on the rate of absorption of moisture and 1s directly connected
with decomposition of this moisture. The decomposition prod-
ucts, hydrogen and oxygen, are carried off in the gas system.
The metering circuitry is arranged so that the meter reads

in parts per million by volume of moisture in the gas stream.

2 Reading the Instruments

Since the analyzers are presumed to
operate in accordance with Faraday's law,
the reading is directly proportional to
the mass of water passing through the
cell per unit time. If C = concentration

of water, F = sample flow, and I = current
Approved by%{({bﬁp&. 3H6-25

9/14/65

6.6.2 (continued)
or meter reading, the I = KCF, where K incorporates all
necessary conversion factors. If F, sample flow, is main-
tained constant, the reading is directly proportional to
the concentration. This is the normal mode of operation
since concentration in ppm H-O may be read directly only
when a constant flow is maintained. The range of the
meter may be varied by varying the sample flow rate:
assume the moisture level 1s constant at 500 ppm with the
range set on 0-1000 and a normal flow of 100 cc/min.;
the reading would be 50% of full scale. Now assume that
the flow is cut to 50 cc/min. The throughput of water
would be 1/2 as much and the reading should drop to 25%
of full scale. Since the moisture content of the gas
did not change, the full scale range would then be four
times 500, or 2000 ppm. Thus, the actual full scale

range is inversely proportional to the fiow rate:

100
actual flow rate’

actual range = indicated range x

where indicated range means the range at 100 cc/min.
For example, if the range is set at 1000 an d the flow

is set at 10 cc/min., the actual range would be
100
1000 x 0 = 10, 000.

Changes in ambient temperature usually affect the reading

because of disturbance of the absorbed moisture eguiiibrium.

Isolation of the salt in the MSRE drain, circulating, and process-
ing systems is controlled by freezing a short plug of salt in a flattened
section of 1 1/2" pipe called a "freeze valve." A combination of cool-
ing air piped to a shroud attached to the flattened section of pipe and
electrical heaters adjacent to the freeze valve is used to freeze or
thaw the valve. Siphon break pots are provided on one or both sides of
the freeze valves to prevent blowing all the salt out of the valve
during transfers and drains.

The electrical heat is manually controlled for the desired condi-
tion. The coolant air is automatically switched between "off," "hold"
and "blast" condition by temperature moduler or switches which obtain
signals from thermocouples attached to the center or either shoulder
of the freeze valve, In the "thaw" condition, all air is turned off.
In the hold condition,sufficient air is supplied to the valve to keep
it frozen. On FV's 104 and 107 through 112, the amount of air is manu-
ally adjusted using HIC's which throttle the cooling air valves. On
FV's 103, 105, 106, 20k and 206, temperature indicator controllers are
provided which regulate the "hold" cooling air to maintain a constant
freeze valve shoulder temperature. The temperature setpoint is manually
adjustable. When the temperature controller is in the manual position,
it functions like the HIC's on the other freeze valve.

1 DEFINITIONS & CRITERIA

1.1l Deep Frozen

When a freeze valve is deep frozen, the cooling air will
be turned off and the salt frozen by lowering or turning off
the electrical heaters.

Fluorine evolution can occur if salt which is in a high
radiation field is cooled below L00°F. Therefore FV 10k
through 109 will be maintained above this temperature. The
upper limit has been arbitrarily set at about 600°F.

Freeze valve 103 is emptied completely during a drain and

therefore can be cooled to ambient temperature. Freeze valves

1.1 (continued)
110, 111, 112, 204 and. 206 can also be cooled to ambient
temperature since they are located in cells having less
radiation.

l.2 Frozen

Freeze valves are considered frozen when the heaters,

cooling air and temperature controllers have been adjusted S0
that a frozen plug exists and turning off the cooling air
will thaw the valve. Freeze valves 103, 204 and 206 have an
additional requirement that they must thaw within 15 minutes
if electrical power fails.

1.3 Thawed

A freeze valve is considered thawed when all portions of

_it are.above the freezing poiht of the salt. 1In general, the

heaters will be on and the cooling air off.

BASIC OPERATION. AND INTERLOCKS

2vi---Ereeze

On each freeze valve, modules 1Al, 1AZ2, 3A1 and 3AZ are
in circuits which control the cooling air flow to the valve.
If the freeze valve is in the normal thawed condition and
the manually operated valve switch is set to freeze, the green
light at the switch on the main control board will start
flashing. The red light will also be on until the center
valve temperature drops to Module 2A1 setpoint (~ 1000°F).
Wheﬁ switched to freeze blast air flow will come on and stay
on until £he both shoulder temperatures drop to Module 1Al
and 3Al setpoints (~ 7509F). At this point Module 1Al and
3A1 open circuits which stops the high air flow but lets the
hold air flow to continue. The green light will be on steady.

- As each shoulder temperature decreases below 85OOF, its module

green light comes on and the amber light goes off. Hold air
flow will be automatically regulated to maintain the preset
temperature on FV 103, 105, 106, 204 and 204. On other freeze

valves, the hold air is adjusted manually.

" 10/18/65

2.1 (continued)

If the valve shoulder temperatures continue to decrease
to ~ 6500F, either module 1A2 or 3A2 with either 1Al or 3Al1
will stop all air flow, and the amber module light will be on
until the temperature increases to above this setpoint.
Temperature above ~ BOOOF will actuate the 1AL or 3Al module
and turn on the high air to prevent valve melt-out. The
green light will start flashing. Either module can actuate
the high air mechanism and the air will continue on until both
shoulder temperatures decrease to normal conditions.

Modules 1Al and 3A1 have ~ 50F hysterisisj;and therefore,
if the air flow is adjusted to hold the shoulder temperatures
between ~ 650 and 800°F, no alarm or control action should
occur. For a control action to be initiated by a freeze valve
requires that a combination of 2 modules be in alarm - either
3A1 and 1Al, 3Al and 2AZ2, or 1Al and 2AZ.

2.2 Thaw Operation

When the manual operating switch is turned to thaw, all
air to the valve is cut off, the red indicating light starts
flashing, and the green light is on until both shoulder tem-
peratures reach approximately 8OOOF (Modules 1Al and 3A1).

When the 2A1 module thermocouple reaches the setpoint
(~ 1000°F), the red light at the freeze valve switch will
stop flashing and be a steady red.

. 2.3 Additional Interlock

In addition to the FV control modules, interlocks are

provided to prevent thawing when the syphon break (pots) or
vertical pipe on either side of the freeze valve are below
lOOOOF and when there is excessive AP between the drain tank
and the circulating system.

to change from normel thawed to normal frozen position or
from normal frozen to normal thawed position. To accomplish
this, the heaters are first adjusted to obtain desired tem-
peratures with the freeze valve in the thawed position, The
freeze valve control is then switched to the freeze position
and the air flow controllers set to control the desired tem-
peratures. (For details see L4I.) |

Normal Operation of Freeze Valves.

During reactor shutdowns, salt transfers or additions may
be made. The transfer freeze valves, FV 107 through 112,
will be adjusted as described in 3.1. Thawing or freezing will
be done using the freeze valve switch. After a transfer and
prior to freezing a walve, it will be necessary to adjust
differential pressures to assure that salt is in the flat
portion of the freeze valve. Detalls of this are covered in
other sections of this report. During shutdown periods,
FV 103 through 106 and 204 and 206 will be deep frozén,

During a startup, F¥ 103, 104, 204 and 206 will be thawed
to allow filling the reactor and coolant system. FV 105
through 112 will be deep frozen. During circulation of flush
and coolant salt, FV 103; 204 and 206 will be in the normal
frozen condition. After the.flush salt is drained, FV 10k
will be deep frozen. FV 105 or 106 will be thawed to fill
the fuel system with fuel salt. After filling and during all
ﬁbﬁé£ p§éfétions; FV 103, 204 and 206 will be normally
frozen, FV 105 and 106 will be thawed, and FV 107 through
112 will be deep frozen.

3J LIQUID WASTE SYSTEM

The liquid waste system is designed to accumulate and dispose of
radicactive aqueous waste material, Facilities are provided for sampling,
diluting, neutralizing, and transferring these to the Melton Valley waste
handling system. This system is also used for clarifying the shielding
water used in the decontamination cell and tank.

Waste handling procedures are given in the following sections.

1 JETTING REACTOR CELL AND DRATIN TANK CELL SUMPS

Any water which accumulates in the sumps of the reactor or drain tank
cells is removed by air jets which discharge to the liguid waste storage
tank. These jets are permanently mounted in the drain tank cell. Pumping
is started by simultaneously opening the air supply valve and alr operated
discharge valves. The operation must be well coordinated because opening
either air supply or jet discharge valves prematurely allows air to be
blown or sucked into the cells which are normally below atmospheric
pressure.

The sumps would be jetted as part of the reactor startup procedure
if there is any liquid in them and during operations whenever a high
gump level is indicated. The procedure requires two technicians. Details
are given below:

3 JETTING AUXILTIARY CELL SUMPS

The sumps in the fuel processing cell, equipment

storage cell, liquid waste cell, and spare cell have steam
jet pumps for the transfer of liquid to the waste tank.
Each of these sumps will be emptied when a high level
for that sump is annunciated. All process cell sumps
have a common annunciator on the main control board
(XA 4000-1) and individual indicator lights in the
auxiliary control room (XA 4029) which can be deacti-
vated to clear the common alarm. Details of jetting
these sumps are given below.

Y BUILDING SUMP OPERATION
The main building sump, with a bottom at the 812-ft level, is

accegsible from the pump room located below the Special Eguipment™
Room. The sump serves the building floor drains and French drains.
There are two 1-1/2 hp sump pumps which are started and stopped auto-
matically by integral float level switches. One starts pumping when the
water level reaches 815' 8" and the other 816 ft. elevation. A start
switch located at Col. C-9, 852-ft level, must be on to activate both
sump pumps. Normally no operator action is reguired. A high sump level
will be alarmed, IA-PRS-A, at 818 £t 6 in. elevation. This alarm can
indicate pump trouble, pumps off or just insufficient pumping capacity.
The sump alarm is connected to the common alarm, XA L000-1, on the main
control board with the cell sumps and individual indicator module on
XA 4029 in the ACR. A switch activates a high coolant cell sump level
alarm and energizes a solenoid valve, ICV 809 to a 1 in. steam jet lo-
cated in the coolant drain cell at elevation 818' 6". This jet takes
suction from coolant drain cell sump which has a bottom elevation of
817 ft., and is connected to the building sump at the 818 ft. elevation.
The float level switch turns off jet when level drops to the 818 foot
elevation.

The steam supply is through V-309 at the 100 psi steam reducilng
station, north of the filter house. The Jjet discharges to the sewer in

the west tunnel. No level indicator is provided.

5 PIT PUMP OPERATTION

The pit pump, located inlthe pump room, is used to transfer water

from the 55-gal. tank in the pump room to the waste tank. The 55-gal.
drum receives water from the ventilation stack and filter pit, and may
be contaminated. A transfer should be made whenever an alarm occurs on
LAPRT (XA 4029). To transfer, open valves V-SD and V-326 in the pump
room and close V-325 and V-330. Start the pump from Col. C-9 on the
852-ft level. The pump should be stopped when the transfer is completed.
If a large quantity of water accumulates in this tank and a radiation
survey indicates no activity, the water can be pumped to the catch basin
by closing V-326 and opening V-330. If activity is found in the main
building sump, the pit pump can be used to pump from the sump to the
waste tank by closing valve V-SD and opening V-325 and V-326. The pit
pump can be used to empty the reactor cell annulus or the charcoal bed
cell into the catch basin by V-330 and either V-329 (RC annulus) or V-328
(CB cell).

If the water is contaminated 1t éan be pumped to the waste tank by
opening V-326 and closing V-330.
6 TREATMENT AND DISPOSAL OF WASTE TANK CONTENTS

The general procedure for handling the contents of the waste tank

will be to circulate and sample contents, dilute if activity is too high
(>5 curies/gal.), adjust pH to >T by caustic addition, mix thoroughly,
resample, and transfer to Melton Valley Waste Station.

9 GENERAL DECONTAMINATION AND CLEAN UP
Periodically the building should be checked for contamination by

health physicists and industrial hygienists. When radiocactive contami-
nation or beryllium is found, the area should be isclated and marked.
A survey should be made to determine source of contamination or beryl-
lium. A cleanup should be started as soon as practical. Where water
will not demage equipment in the area, plenty of hot water, detergent,
scouring powder or soap should be used to scrub the area. Then the
area should be rinsed. This procedure should he repeated as necessary
until the area is approved by health physics.

Caution should be used to prevent spread of the contamination.
Contaminated or beryllium containing water should be put into the
liquid waste storage tank through the caustic addition funnel in the
high bay.

Electrical equipment, instruments, and panels containing equipment
which cannot be wetted, should be wiped clean with damp sponges and
detergent or scouring powder and followed by a damp sponge rinse. Many
repetitions of washing and rinsing may be required. Used sponges, etc.
should be put into the hot Dempster Dumpster or hot cans provided.

Equipment having porous coverings, such as insulation which would
absorb moisture should be cleaned, using an approved vacuum cleaner.
When possible the air from the vacuum cleaner should be discharged into

a ventilation duct.

3K Be MONITORING SYSTEM

The Be Monitoring system consists of four units which take air
samples from various areas of the MSRE facility and the Be concentration
in the sample is determined. The operation and maintenance of this
system is the responsibility of the IH (Industrial Hygiene) Department;
however, the operations group will provide assistance as described in
the following parts of this procedure.

1 GENERAL BUILDING AIR SAMPLING SYSTEM

1.1 One of the units consists of two alr pumps, only one of which

is in operation at any one time, with 15 sample points connected
to it. The sample points are located as shown on dwg. D-ZZ4-Z
56399. Each has a paper-type filter which removes the par-
ticulate matter from the air sample drawn through it. The
filter is removed and analyzed for Be periodically by the IH
Department. The MSRE Operations personnel will check the air
pumps periodically to assure that one is operating and pulling
a vacuum of ~ 1.8" Hg. If the pump has stopped, the standby
pump will be started and the IH Department informed of the
failure. A low vacuum (<1.8" Hg.) would indicate an open
line on the pump suction side or the pump is not operating
properly. In this event the operating pump will be stopped,
the standby pump started and the IH Department notified. If
the trouble can be corrected by personnel available when it
is discovered, it will be done. This pump becomes the standby
pump when the trouble is corrected.

2 VENTILATION SYSTEM AIR SAMPLING

2.1 The second unit consists of a small air pump with the single

sample point. It also uses g paper-type filter to collect

the particulate matter and takes the air sample from the main
building ventilation duct upstream of the filter pit. It is
operated in essentially the same manner as the 15 sample point
system. Since there is no standby pump, any trouble developing

will be corrected as soon as it is practical. The IH Department

3 NSL Be AIR MONITORING UNIT

3.1

The third unit consists of an NSL. Be Air Monitor. This instru-
ment collects an air éample from the duct upstream of the venti-
lation filter pit and makes an éhalysis for Be concentration
once per:ﬁour automatically. ﬂ.local alarm occurs if the Be
concentrétion is >2 ug/m3. ﬁ%erations personnel will check
the instrument periodically énd inform the IH Department as
soon as possible if an alarﬁrhas occurred due to a Be level.

If the alarm is due to insqfument trouble and the shift instru-
ment mechanic cannot correét it, the IH Department will be
informed as soon as possibie if it occurs between the hours

of 0800 and 1@%0. Otherwgse, it will be put on standby and
the IH Department informed at 0800. Operations personnel will
check and service the instrument in accordance with the in-

structions of the IH Depértment.

L COOLANT SYSTEM STACK Be MONITORING UNIT

4.1

The fourth unit is an Atomic Instrument Co. Be Air Monitor
which normally monitors the air in the coolant system stack.
The instrument is located in the vent house and takes its air
sample through a tube connected to the stack. During shutdown
operations it can be connected to tubes which take the air
sample from the coolant cell. This will be done during
maintenance operations which require that the salt containing
pipe and equipment be opened. Air samples are taken and
analyzed on a continuous basis. A high Be level (>2 ug/m3)
or instrument trouble will give an alarm in the CR. If it is
due to instrument trouble which the shift instrument mechanic
cannot correct or a high Be level, the IH Department will be
notified as soon as possible regardless of the time when the
alarm occurs. The instrument will be checked and serviced

by the operations personnel as instructed by the IH Department.

SECTION k4

AUXTLTARY SYSTEMS STARTUP CHECK LISTS

Successful operation of the reactor depends upon all essential
equipment and instrumentation functioning properly. Prior to each
startup all equipmentlis checked to assure that it is in the proper
operating condition, all necessary motors are started, all valve and
breaker positions are set and operational tests are made on all
esgsential instrumentation.

The check lists covering these operations are given in this section.
Items are listed by systems rather than chronologically and except where
there is interdependence these can be completed in any order. Where
possible items are grouped by areas to facilitate completion of the lists.

All operations listed must be completed before each reactor start-

up unless their deletion is approved by the operations chief.

4B INSTRUMENT AIR SYSTEM STARTUP CHECK LIST

The instrument air system will normally be operated with one instru-
ment air compressor, one air dryer and both air receivers in service,
with the second instrument air compressor and air dryer in standby.

This check list covers the startup of the instrument air system for
normal operation, and assumes that related portions of the electric
system check list have been completed. Some portions of the system may
already be in service; however, each item listed should be checked.

Bolt down the upper shield blocks.

A leak rate test of the RC and DTC will be per-
formed at 20 psig prior to start-up after either
of the cells has been opened. A number of.the
valves will also be tested while the cells are

at 20 psig pressure. These are HCV's 930 A & B,
V 930 C, V's 955 A, B, & C, CV 332, CV 342, FCV's
333 A& B, FCV's 343 A & B, CV 965, and CV 966.

Open V 980 A & B before pressurizing,

There are numerous other valves, penetrations and
lines which require periodic leak testing at a

cell pressure of 20 psig. When these are to be
tested it will be done while the cells are at

20 psig for the leak rate test. Others requiring
the periodic leak test which can be performed with
the cells at 0 psig will be tested when the cells
are depressurized after the 20 psig leak rate test,
The penetrations and their locations are given in
tables 4.1 ahd 4.2 in the MSRE Design and Opera-
tions Report, Part VIII,.

The detailed steps for the leak tests follow. The
first group is tested each time a leak rate test

at 20 psig is performed. The second group is tested
periodically during one of the 20 psig leak rate
tests. The third group is tested periodically with
the second group following the 20 psig leak rate
test.

LT Freeze Valves

The following check list covers the complete startup of each freeze
valve and adjusting each so that freezing and thawing can be accomplished
using the freeze valve switch on the main control board. This does not
need to be done on each valve on each startup. If a number of transfers
or additions are to be made, it may be desirable to set up FV-107 through
112 in this manner. However, for a single transfer it may be easier to
go directly from deep freeze to the thaw condition using heaters and
manual control of the air. When transfers are complete, the valves will
be deep frozen.

During a normal startup, FV-10k through 106 will normally be either
deep frozen or thawed, and no extensive adjustments are required. The
thawing of these 1s described in Section 5I.

On each startup, FV-103, 204 and 206 must be set up so that they
will thaw when required. These are also covered in Section 51.

The setting of the temperature switches, and freeze valve HIC's
and TIC's are covered in Section 4H.

The following is a detailed description of the steps necessary in
setting up a freeze valve for automatic operation. Table 4I-1 and 2
should be used for recording the data obtained.

1 DETATILED PROCEDURE

1.1 Obtain shift supervisor's permission to proceed. (Column 1.1)

1.2 Check that the associated lines are heated. Thaw or check
that the freeze valve is in the thaw position (Check that
interlocks are clear). (Column 1.2)

1.3 Adjust plug control heaters to give the temperature listed.
Record final temperatures. (Column 1.3)

1.4 Check that pressure on both sides of FV is balanced. Switch
freeze valve ﬁo freeze position and set blast air HIC to
value given. (Column 1.4)

1.5 When both shoulder thermocouples reach ~ TSOOF, the alarm will
clear and the cooling air will be reduced from blast to hold.

Set TIC's on automatic. Adjust hold air HIC or set TiIC to

i v T | 10/14/65

1.5 (continued)
give the shoulder temperatures listed. Record final HIC

setting and shoulder temperatures. (Column 1.5)

1.6 When the freeze valve is thawed, note time required for valve
to thaw. Accurate indication of thaw time can only be obtained
by salt flow as indicated by rapid change in FV temperatures.
Less accurate indications can be obtained from the thermo-

couples without salt flow. Record any results obtained

(Column 1.6).
