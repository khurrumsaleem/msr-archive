PREFACE

The report on the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE) has been
arranged into twelve major parts as shown below. FEach of these covers
a particular phase of the project, such as the design, safety analysis,
operating procedures, etc. An attempt has thus been made to avoid much
of the duplication of material that would result if separate and inde-
pendent reports were prepared on each of these major aspects,

Detailed references to supporting documents, working drawings, and
other information sources have been made throughout the report to make
it of maximum value to ORNL personnel. Each of the major divisions of
the report contains the bibliographical and other appendix information
necessary for that part.

The final volumes of the report, Part XII, contain rather extensive
listings of working drawings, specifications, schedules, tabulations,
etc. These have been given a limited distribution.

Most of the reference material is available through the Division
of Technical Information Extension, Atomic Energy Commission, P.0. Box
62, Oak Ridge, Tennessee. For material not available through this source,
such as inter-ILaboratory correspondence, etc., special arrangements can
be made for those having a particular interest.

None of the information contained in this report is of a classified
nature.

SECTION 5
REACTOR STARTUP

After the auxiliary startup check lists have been completed, there
i1s still a considerable number of operations to be done prior to power
operation. The details of these are given in this section in chrono-
logical order. In each section a general description is given as to
what 1s to be done, what precautions are necessary and suggests corrective
action in case of difficulty.‘ This 1s followed by detailed check lists.
Section 5K describes the normal operation of the plant. Information
is given as to what equipment should be operated and in general how it
1s to be operated. The operational limits are covered by the Building

S5A PURGIﬁ%vOXYGEN AND MOISTURE FROM THE SALT SYSTEMS

 

After any appreciable amount of atmospheric contamination has occurred, as
when & system is opened for meintenance, it will be ﬁecessary to purge out most
of the oxygen and moigture befcre heat-up.

By evacuation and refilling the coolant system with helium, the oxygen and
moisture content can be reduced to a tolerable (~100 ppm) level. However, evacu-~
ation cannot be used on the fuel or fuel drain tank systems because fission gases
would be released from the charcoal beds. Oxygen and moisture will be removed
from the fuel system by purging a sufficlent amount of heliumfﬁﬁilé mixing with
the fuel pump. Since mixing during a continuous purge is not possible in the

fuel drain tenks, alternate pres jure-vent cycles will be used.

1  PURGING THE FUEL SYSTEM Init. Date & Time

Purging of the fuel system after maintenance will

 

consisgt of introducing helium into as many openings
as possible, circulating it with the fuel pump, and
venting continuously through the main charcoal beds.
A minimum of 9 fuel system volumes (~675 ft3) of helium
will be required to lower the oxygen concentration from
atmospheric to < 100 ppm. Details are given below:
1.1 Cleose or check that the following valves are
closed:

NOTE: The CFT bubblers may be plugged because

 

of a frozen heel of salt. This will be indicatead
by a high pressure on FI 599 and FI 600 (alarms

on XA 4006-6) and a false high level indication

on LI 599 and LI 600 (alarm on XA 4007-2). In

this event close block valves HV 599 and HV 600.

It would then be necessary to relieve the pressure
by turning test switch S-38 momentarily to
"equalizer No. 1" and then to "equilizer No. 2"
positions. Wait until the OFT temperature is

above salt liquidus before placing plugged bubblers

back ito service. Indicate condition of bubblers:

 

 

 

1.3.7 Set FIC 516 to maximum flow (~5 1/m).

1.6 After purging for the length of time determined
above (approx 30 hrs), reduce the purge to normal

flow rate (see secticn 5.I1.2.8 and 5.1.2.9).

 

1.7 Continue the normal purge rate (total approx
.2 1/m) during reactor startup to further
reduce oxygen concentration in the gas to below
10C ppm which would represent < 1 ppm oxide in
8,800 1bs of salt.

 

2  PURGING THE FUEL DRAIN TANKS

 

Purging of a fuel system drain tank after it has been
opened to atmosphere for any reason consists of alter-

nately pressurizing and venting of helium. Pressure

changes of 5 psi will be made by alternately pressurizing
to T psig and venting to 2 psig. To reduce the oxygen
concentration from atmospheric to < 500 ppm before heat
up is begun will require 24 cycles. An additional 6
cycles will be performed during heat up to lower oxygen
concentration to < 100 ppm. Each pressure cycle will
regquire in excess of an hour due to flow limitations

of FE 517. The theoretical number of AP cycles to

reduce oxygen concentration to any desired value may be

determined by:

where N = number of pressure cycles purge gas required
Co = beginning concentration O2 in ppm
C = desired or end concentration O2 in ppm
Pl = end vent cycle pressure, psia
Pé = end pressure cycle, psia.

2.1 Check that the cover gas system is in operation.
2.2 Check that the drain tank, associated fill and

 

transfer piping, and freeze valves, to be purged
are at room temperature (Mark through tank(s)

not to be purged).

PURGING OF THE COOLANT PTPING AND DRAIN TANK

~ Purging of the coolant piping system and coolant drain

tank will consist of evacuation of 0.5 psia or less

and refilling with helium. Provisions will be made

for the prevention of beryllium contamination from

the vacuum system.

If the coolant system or coolant drain tank system

5¢  HEATUP OF DRAIN TANK SYSTEM

This section covers the heatup of ¥FD-1, FD-2, FFT, and asscciated
lines. In general, whenever a tank is heated, the lines will be heated
and kept hot from this drain tank to the first freeze valves. From this
point the lines can be heated or cooled depending on the operation in
progress. Heatup of lines necessary for salt addition will be covered in
5D; heatup of the fuel and coolant systems and the £ill lines will be
covered in 5F, and heatup of the transfer lines and fuel storage tank
will be covered in 11A.

In this procedure, the details of the heatup of each tank are listed
separately; however, all can be heated simultaneously if desired. When
possible the TE's on lines and vessels which are being heated should be
monitored continuocusly. Equipment previously heated should be monitored
at least ftwice per shift tec prevent overheating or freezing.

In normal operation FD-1, FD-2, FFT and CDT will be maintained at
1100 to 1200°F. The FST may be cooled if desired. The transfer freeze
valves and other pockets of salt located in a high gamma field shall be
maintained at 4OO°F to 600°F to prevent the excessive evolution of Ffluorine.
The empty lines may be cocled to ambient temperature.

It is assumed that the tanks and lines being heated may contain salt.
To prevent rupture due to the expansion of the salt as it is heated, the
tank will be heated first followed by the section of pipe next to the tank
and continued in this order until the line is heated to the freeze valve.
The maximum permissible heatup or cooldown rate is 100°F per hour.

1 HEATUP OF FD-1 AND ADJACENT LINES

H-107-2 and H-107-3 as close together as
possible and lagging TE-107-1 about 200°F.

 

Continue the procedure of turning on
successive heaters on line 107 out to the
freeze valve. The last heater turned on
should be H-FV-107-3. Keep the temperature
under each successive heater about 200°F
lower than the adjacent heater to it on the

tank side until 850°F is exceeded.

 

Level off all temperatures between 1100°F
and 12C0°F,

This section covers the heatup of CDT and
204 to the shoulders of FV-204 and FV-206.
Check that freeze valves 204 and 206 are
switched to freeze and that temperatures

indicate that they are frozen.

 

Unplug the thermocouples listed in Table

5C-7 and plug them into a special recorder so
the heatup may be closely followed. Finish
filling out Table 5C-7. OSwing link the scan-
ner "C" points which are removed. Keep both

thermocouple logs up to date.

 

Close the following wvalves.

HCV-511 HCV-547
Depending upon operation, it is possible
that jumpers may be needed in circuits 140

and 141 in order to close HCV-54T7. Approval

 

to insert jumpers .

As the tank heats up, keep a careful watch
on PR-511D to prevent overpressurizing the
tank. Periodically vent through HCV-527

when necessary to keep the pressure between

3 and T psig.

 

If the CDT is already hot, start heating up
line 20k by turning on H-204-2 to give a
heat-up rate of ~ 100°F/hr on TE-204-8A and
TE-204-B7A then skip to step 4.7. If the tank
Approved by%f?z%%%éiézﬁ¢ﬂvL

L.5 (continued)
is cold and empty, turn on heaters CDT-1,

2, and 3 to 75% of their 1200°F current
setting and continue with step L4.6.

4.6 The tank heat-up may be followed by watching
the points listed in Table 5C-T7. Additional
tank temperatures may be observed on scanner
"C". When the tank temperature is approxi-
mately LOO°F, turn on H-204-2. Keep the line
temperature less than the tank temperature.

4.7 When the temperature under heater 204-2
reaches ~ LOO°F, turn on heater FV-204-3.
Keep the temperature of the freeze valve pot
about 200°F less than the temperatures under
H-204-2 until the pot exceeds 850°F.

L.8 The coclant drain tank heaters should be
set to their 1200°F settings when the coolant
drain tank heat-up rate begins to level off.

4.9 Turn on H-FV-204-2 when TE-FV-204-5B reaches
LOO°F. Keep TE-FV-20L-5B at least 200°F
above TE-206-7 until TE-206-7 exceeds 850°F.

4.10 Make adjustments necessary to level the
temperatures out at 1200°F. However, do
not exceed the 1200°F setting on H-FV-204-2.
Since this heater is next to a section of
frozen salt, it may not reach 1200°F until
the freeze valve heaters are turned on.

%¥,11 If jumpers were inserted in step 4.3, re-
move them.

L.12 After the tank and lines are heated, place
the thermoccouples listed in Table 5C-7 back
to their normal readout., Keep the thermo-

couple logs up to date.

5D ADDITION OF FUEL,‘FLUSH'AND COOLANT SALT
TO THE DRATN TANKS

 

 

NOTE: If no salt is to be added, section 5D can be ommitted.

Fuel, flush, and coolant salt will be prepared by the Reactor Chemistry Division
and will be stored as a solid under a helium blanket until it is charged to the system,
Nonuranium salt will be handled in cans holding 250 to 300 1lb each. Uranium will be
charged as the UF
50 1b.

Two portable furnaces and control units furnished by the Reactor Chemistry Divi-

4'Lin eutectic (27 mole % UFu) from smaller cans containing 30 to

sion will be used for heating the salt. Each can will be weighed, heated, pressur-
ized to the system, cooled and reweighed.

Fuel or flush salt can be charged directly to the fuel drain tanks, fuel flush
tank, or to the fuel storage tank from the charging station in the high bay. Charg-
ing after criticality will be done via the fuel storage tank to provide an additional
freeze valve between the reactor and the charging station. The charging line will be
blanked off at the 852-ft elevation when not in use. To minimize intermixing of
different salts, lines to all other tanks will be prefilled before addition and will
be emptied afterward. Special instructions will be issued when needed. .

Coolant salt will be charged directiy to the coolant drain tank from the coolant
salt charging station, located above the special equipment room. The same furnaces
and control units used for charging fuel will be used for the coolant salt. The
charge line will be blanked off at the coolant drain tank when not in use.

Details of both charging operations follow,

Fuel and Flush Salt Charging (Fig, 5D~1)

 

(Note: This procedure assumes that the freeze valves have been filled with
salt and oxygen has been purged from the system.)

5E STARTUP OF LUBE OIL SYSTEMS
for the
FUEL AND COOLANT CIRCULATING PUMPS

The lube o0il systems must be in operation before the fuel and cool-
ant pumps are started and/or heated. The pressure on the lube 0il stor-
age tank should be maintained at 2 to 8 psi above the pump pressures.
Normally, FOP-2 and COP-2 will be in operation with FOP-1 and COP-1 in
standby. The lube cil systems are congidered to be closed systems, and
therefore, have no block valves to isclate them from the cell. There-
fore, no valve from the 0il systems to the atmosphere should be opened
while the reactor is in operation without written approval of the opera-
tion chief.

To start up the lube oil systems, oil is added to the supply tank,
the tanks are purged and pressurized with helium, the valves are set,
the pumps started and flows adjusted. It may be also necessary to drain
the oil from the oil-catch tanks.

5F HEATUP OF FUTT, AND COOLANT SYSTEMS

The heatup rabe of the fuel and coolant systems should not exceed
100°F per hour, and since the two systems are connected at the heat ex-
changer, the temperature range of all points on both systems should be
kept as close as is practical. The circulating pumps will run during
heatup, and the helium purge flow will be kept at the normal rate. This
is to aid in heating up the graphite and help purge out any remaining
OXygen.

To minimize thermal stresses, the component coolant alr flow should
be flowing to the control rods and reactof neck during the heatup.

Details of the operation are given below.

2.2 The reactor vessel will be the most slovwly
heated component due to its large mass.
Turn on and adjust the remainder of the
heaters listed in Tables 5F-1, 5F-Z, and
SF-3 so as to keep the temperatures under
these heaters more than the reactor but
within 150°F of the reactor. The heater
calibration curves may be used as a gulde
in making heater adjustments.

NOTE: ©Part of the method of monitoring the radia-

 

tor heatup will be Scanners "D" and "E." Note
that these have variable references and will need

to be adjusted as the heatup progresses.

As the heatup progresses, the temperature

of the penetrations should be given special
attention. Try to keep the piping tempera-
ture on both sides of the penetration as
close to the pipe temperature in the pene-
tration as is possible. Record the tempera-

tures as indicated in Table 5F-5.

 

When the temperatures indicated by TE-CR-124
and TE-CR-122 (points 34 and 35 on Scanner
B) are above 900°F, the flow element should
be heated. The following steps should be
used.

TE-CR-123 (T1-3200 Pt.7) O
TE-CR-122 (Scanner B Pt. 35) °F

 

2.5.2 If CR-124 and CR-122 indicate tem-
peratures above 9OOOF, turn on the
flow element heaters. These are listed

in Table 5F-4.

level off the heatup rate of the
flow elements and keep at the same

temperature as line Z0L.

 

2.6 When the temperature indicated by
TE-103-13 is above 900°F, start
heating the short section of line
106 ag follows.

2.6.1 Plug the thermocouples listed
in Table 5F-6 into one of the
special recorders so heatup of this
section of line may be closely fol-
lowed. Finish filiing out Table
5F-6A. Keep thermocouple logs
up to date.

 

2.6.2 When TE-103-13 is above 900°F,
turn on H-106-4. Adjust to give a
heatup rate of flOOOF/hr. This
section of line must be heated very
carefully due to the likely pres-
ence of salt in the lines. Do not
allow the temperature of TE-106-5A
to exceed TE-FV-105-6B. Table 5F-T
should be filled in to aid the oper-
ator in keeping up with the tempera-

tures of the thermocouples.

 

2.6.3 Do not exceed the 1200°F setting
on heater 106-4. The temperatures

shoulder heaters are turned on and/or
the temperature of all thermocouples

in 5F-6 are above 1100°F. See Pro-

cedure 51 for freeze valve heatup.

 

2.7 Level all temperatures in the loops at 1100
to lZOOOF. Make heater adjustments neces-
sary to accomplish this (such as lowering
the reactor heaters from 105% to 100% of
their 1200°F setting).

 

GENERAL NOTE: The heatup of the drain tanks and lines
out to the freeze valves is covered in Procedure 5C.

Heatup of the freeze valves shoulders is covered in
the fill Procedure (5I).

5H ROUTINE PRESSURE TEST

The fuel'system will be periodically tested (approximately every
year) at 65 psig and 1200°F and after opening any system. The coolant
system will be tested at 65 psig and 1200°F. The test procedure is de-
signed to provide (1) a strength test of the reactor piping and equipment,
(2) a rough indication of any leakage from the reactor piping, and (3) an
operating check of préssure switches which are actuated during the course
of the test.

In order to thoroughly test the heat exchanger, the fuel system will
be pressurized to 65 psig with the coolant system at essentially atmos-
pheric pressure, and the cooclant system will be pressurized to 65 psig
after the fuel system is at atmospheric pressure. Since FD-1, FD-2, and
FFT will Dbe connected to the fuel system during operation, they will be
included in the test. The FST will not be included but will be tested
prior to any chemical processing. The CDT will be included when the
coolant system is tested. To avoild excessive pressure on the pump seals,
the lube oil systems will be pressurized. Valves will be closed in the
offgas lines upstream of the charcoal beds, thus isolating them from the
test. The fuel and coolant samples will be tested during the sampler
startup.

Prior to starting the test, the salt piping and equipment must be at
1200°F, the reactor and drain cell must be sealed and evacuvated to 12.7 psia.
To prevent transfer of salt, the necessary freeze valves will be frozen,
and the gas spaces of the various systems will be interconnected. The
test may be run with the systems empty or with coolant salt in the coolant
system and flush salt in the fuel system.

Details of the procedure are given below:

1. Check that all auxiliary systems startup operations listed in

Sections LA through 4T have been completed, or the Operations
Chief has approved items omitted.
Operations Chief's approval to proceed with system empty or

with salt circulating.

51 FILLING THE FUEL AND COOLANT SYSTEMS

When the coclant system temperatures reach 1000 to llOOOF, it will
be filled with salt, the freeze valves will be frozen, and circulation
of coolant salt will be started. When the fuel and coolant system
temperatures reach 1150 to lZOOOF and the graphite temperatures are
above llOOOF, the fuel system will be filled with either flush salt or
fuel salt depending on condition of the system. t is estimated that
heatup should take about 36 hours which is sufficient time to heat up
the graphite. The outlet gas temperature is essentially the same as the
top graphite temperature and therefore could be a good indication of
graphite heatup rate. However, the installed thermocouples will probably
be affected more by the heater temperatures than by the gas temperature
in the system.

After the fuel system has been filled with flush salt, FV-103 will
be frozen, the reactor access nozzle freeze joint will be established,
and the fuel pump will be started. The flush salt will be circulated
for at least two hours and sampled prior to draining to the fuel flush
tank.

The fuel system will then be filled with fuel salt. The filling
will be done with all three control rods withdrawn to the prefill
elevation. The reactor will be filled in several steps, with sufficient
time delay between steps for neutron multiplication to be determined.
If'criticality appears feasible, filling will be discontinued.

When the proper level is reached in the pump bowl, FV-103 will be
frozen and the fuel pump started.

Details of the operations are given below:

5.1 Check that heater H-106-4 is on at normal

 

operating setting. Heatup Procedure 5H5F
calls for all drain line heaters being on
with exception of the FV shoulders. Because
of the configuration of pipe and heaters in
this area, this temperature is dependent
also upon FV-105 and FV-106 shoulder heaters.
Note that TS FV 105-6A (temperature at the
"Tee") must be above 900 F before valve can
be thawed. The temperature of the lower
end of line 103 and the "Tee' may be read
out on special recorder. See Procedure

5F, Step 26 and Table 5F-6 as used for

this heatup. As valve shoulders are

heated in the next step, note that temper-
ature gradient is such that the "Tee"
reaches melting temperature before the

FV shoulders.

5J CRITICALITY AND POWER OPERATION

The fuel and coolant salt will be circulated subcritically in the
loops until power operation is desired, at which time the control rods
will be withdrawn to obtain criticality.

During normal power operation, programming of the heat removal appa-
ratus and positioning of the control rods will be done by a preset instru-
mented system. However, if desired for special tests, complete manual
control is possible.

1 PREPARATION FOR POWER OPERATION

Prior to taking the reactor critical the system should be checked

 

to assure that all pertinent equipment and instrumentation are func-
tioning properly. The amount of testing depends upon the length of
the shutdown prior to startup and what was done during the shutdown.
If the reactor has been subcritical for as long as a day, 1.1 through
1.4 should be completed. If the shutdown has been extensive, all
items listed below should be completed.

Init. Date/Time

 

1.1 Check rod drop time for each rod toc be less
than 1 second. (Check List LH-12.6).

1.2 Check fiducial zero of each rod (Check List
LH-12.5).

1.3 Check flux, period, temperature, and voltage
scram on each channel (Check List 8D-k4).

1.4 Check that thermocouples on the radiator

 

 

 

outlet tubes are plugged into Scanner D and
E and that the gain on both scanners is set
at 100 so that an alarm will occur at QSOOF
or 1250°F.

 

1.5 Complete the entire safety circuits (Check
List 8D).

1.6 Complete the neutron instruments (Check List
8A).

2 STARTING POWER OPERATION USING AUTOMATIC LOAD CONTROL
AND ROD SERVO

The rods will be withdrawn manually to attain criticality.

 

When the flux demand setpoint is reached, the servo controller will
manipulate the regulating rod to control the power at the setpoint.

To increase the nuclear power, the flux demand will be increased.
This may cause the regulating rod to withdraw until the regulating-
rod limit is reached. The limit can be changed by operating the
regulating-rod drive switch or the shim rods can be manually with-
drawn which will cause the regulating rod to insert.

As the flux demand is increased, the nuclear power will cause
the system temperatures to rise necessitating removal of heat at
the radiator. Number one blower will be started and the resultant
AP across the radiator will cause the bypass damper to open. Switch-
ing the load-demand switch to the "increase" position will cause
the radiator doors to open. The reactor-outlet temperature will be
maintained constant by manually balancing the load and flux demand.
Interlocks prevent automatically raising the power above 1 mw unless
the reactor is in "run."

Before pushing the run button, the powers should be between
0.5 and 1 Mw; both range selectors should be in the 1.5 Mw range,
and the temperature-demand setpoint should be slightly lower than
the outlet temperature. The regulating rod should be in the center
portion of its useful range and not at either the insert or with-
draw limit. When the reactor is switched to the "run" mode, the

range selector will be sealed in the 15 Mv range, and the rod-control
o
Approved Dby T \@’//4’1ﬂr\ 5J -3

9/14/65

circuitry will be changed from flux serve to temperature servo.
Under these conditions, the regulating rod will be automatically
inserted or withdrawn to maintain the reactor-outlet temperature
constant. The temperature can be changed by adjusting the tempera-
ture-demand setpoint. The load-demand switch will be held in the
increase position to increase the heat-removal rate at the radiator
to the desired power. The sequence of operations, which automati-
cally occur as the heat-removal rate is increased is as follows:

The doors will open completely. This will set up the circuitry
to start raising the AP setpoint resulting in the bypass damper
closing. When the damper is completely closed, No. 3 blower will
start automatically. This will increase the AP above the AP set-
point, and the bypass damper will reopen. Further increase in load
demand will increase the AP setpoint, and the bypass damper will
clese. Operation at 10 mw will be reached with both doors open,
both blowers in operation and the bypass damper partially closed.
If the regulating rod reaches the withdraw limit, No. 2 and No. 3
rod will have to be manually withdrawn or the limit will have to |
be raised. Rod 2 and 3 should always be withdrawn the same amount
(within 1 inch of each other).

Details of the procedure are given below:

MANUAL AND SPECIAL POWER OPERATION
The reactor heat load and flux can be adjusted manually in a

number of -different ways. These may be desirable for special tests.

Details procedures will be written when needed.

The control rods can be manipulated manually to attain criti-
cality and adjust power using the individual actuator switches.
The regulating-rod limits have no function when in manual control.
Group insertion is possible at all times and group withdrawal can
be done when in the start mode. Rods 2 and 3 will normally be

withdrawn and inserted the same amount within 1 in. of each other.

At very low powers it may be necessary to adjust power removal
by adjusting the electrical heaters or it may be advantageous to
raise one or both radiator doors with the blower off. At higher
power with one or both of the blowers on, fine adjustment may be
made by setting the doors at a fixed position and changing the
bypass-damper position. The damper control may be set on avtomatic
which will hold a constant radiator AP or on manual which will

maintain a fixed damper position.

5K NORMAL OPERATING CONDITIONS

Normal operation of the reactor is considered to be whan fuel galt

The nuclear power will depend on the experimental program. Norral values
Tor other monitored variables are given in the building logs or ca he
compuver log sheete, details of experimewnts in progress are outlined
the run instructions, and operating limits are listed in Part VI. A
general description of the operations is given below.

The reacter outlet temperature will normally be held at 12250F and
other clreulating salt temperatures be allowed to vary with power. The
nuclear power and the heat removal rate will be adjusted to athain
steady state. Normally the heat load will be adjusted through the auto
load-control system. (At times manual contfol will be exercised over
the doors, damper, and blowers.) Nuclear power will normally be con-
trolled by the servo system: below about -l Mw the system will be in
the "start” mode and the servo will hold the power at a selected set-
point; at higher powers, the system will normally be in "run" and the
servo will adjust the nuclear power as required to maintain the selected
reactor outlet temperature. In this mode the nuclear power will be
brought to the prescribed level by adjusting the heat load.

Capsules of enriching salt will be added at intervals of approxi-
mately one week or longer tc compensate for #2°U burnup and the slow
growth of long-iived fission-product poisons. The regulating rod
(under servo control) and the shim rods will be adjusted to compensate
for shorter-term effects associated with changes in power level. The
shim rods will be adjusted as necessary 10 keep the regulating rod with-
in its most effective range, 8 to 39-inch withdrawal, and at least L
inches below the two shim rods. The two shim rods will be kept even
with each other. As the regulating rod is automatically insertsd or
withdrawn, the servo limit switches will be adjusted as necessary to
prevent the rod from encountering cither 1limit.

The logger-computer will ordinarily be in service, if not, normal
cperation can continue but with an increase in manual surveillance and

logging. 1In particular, if the computer is out of service, special
 

Approved byféz?2224622?4“4“4 : 5K-2

attention must be given to the reactivity behavior to watch for abnormal .
behavior. (When the computer is in service, a reactivity balance will be

computed every 5 minutes, monitoring for any deviation of the reactivity

from the normal behavior.)

The heaters on lines and equipment in the fuel and coolant systems
will be kept at approximately the same settings as required to hold the
temperatures in the system at lZZBOF when subcritical except for the
fuel-pump heaters which will be reduced in order to increase their usable
life.

FV-103, 204, and 206 will be frozen, but the temperatures will be
maintained so that they will thaw upon loss of electrical power in less
than 15 min. FV-105 and FV-106 will be thawed, and elther drain tank
shall have sufficient free space to drain the entire reactor system.
FV-104 and 107 through 112 will be deep frozen and will not thaw upon
loss of electrical power. However, all salt subjected to high radiation
(if in reactor or drain tank cells) will be kept above LOO°F to prevent
Tluorine evolution.

Temperatures in FD-1, FD-2, FFT, and the CDT will be kept above
1000°F. The FST may be cooled to ambient temperature if required. No
salt processing will be done while fuel or flush salt is in reactor. .
All drain lines in the fuel and coolant system will be kept above the
freezing point of the salt.

The proper water level will be maintained in the feedwater tank for
Nos. 1 and 2 steam drums, and cooling-tower water will be run continuously
through the condensers so that the afterheat removal system is in standby
condition.

Cover gas and bubbler flows will be maintained to the fuel and cool-
ant pumps. The offgas from the fuel pump will be sent to the maln char-
coal beds, and the coolant-pump offgas will go directly to the contain-
ment-ventilation filters. The equalizer valves HCV-5L4k, 545, and 546
between the fuel drain and the flush tanks and the fuel pump as well as
HCV~527 between the coolant-drain tank and the coolant pump will be open.

The helium-supply and vent valves on FD-1, FD-2, FFT, and CDT will be

clogsed. The FST will normally be maintained at a slight positive pressure.
Approved bydfﬁgéj;%fg?/ﬂlﬂWI 5K-3

The fuel system, coclant system, ¥D-1, FD-2, FFT, and CDT will be main-
tained at about 5 psig pressure by throttling PCV-522 and PCV-528 in the
offgas flow from the pumps. Two sections of the main charcoal beds will
be on stream at all times with the others valved off and in standby.

Lubrication and coolant oil will be circulated through the fuel
pump using FOP 1 or Z and through the coolant pump using COP 1 or 2. The
pumps will be alternated weekly. The over-pressure on the oil supply
tanks will be maintained at 7 psig. The oil level in the supply tank
will be maintained above 40%. Upon a gross leak in a pump seal, it is
desirable for the oil supply to the bearings to be shut off immediately;
however, a small leak can be tolerated indefinitely. It will, therefore,
be necessary to periodically change the level setpoint, on LI-0T-1-A3
and LI-OI-2-A3. This should never exceed 2% below indicated level.

The level in the oil catch tanks gives an indication of the leakage
through the seals. The large diameter upper portion of the tank is pro-
vided for shutdown margin in case of gross seal leakage. Therefore, the
0il level in the catch tanks will be kept below the upper portions. (<50%
on LI-524 or LI-526).

The cover-gas supply will be from a helium trailer with a bank of 6
standard helium cylinders in standby. One of the main helium dryers and
oxygen-removal units will be in service, and the others will be valved
off and at reduced temperature in standby. The auxiliary dryer downstream
of the main units will be in service.

A1l leak-detector headers will be pressurized to approximately 100
psig with all valves to in-cell flanges open. All header "A" valves will
be open and "B" valves closed.

Component coolant pump No. 1 or No. 2 will be in service for keeping
in-cell freeze plugs frozen and for cooling the fuel-pump bowl, control
rods, and reactor-access plug. Component coolant pump No. 2 will be
operated for the first full (7 day) week of each month to insure proper
operation and will be kept in standby to replace CCP No. 1 the rest of
the time. The No. 3 component coolant pump will be in operation to
keep the freeze valves in the coolant system and transfer lines frozen.

(Deep-frozen freeze valves may not require coolant air.) The service
swproved by P mem -

Y 9/17/65

alr compressor provides emergency cooling air and will be operated when
needed,

The reactor and drain-tank cell pressure will be held constant at
about 12.7 psia, using the component coolant pump No. 1 or No. 2. Valves
in the evacuation line (569) will be throttled to hold the pressure with-
in limits. UNitrogen will be continuously added to the cells to keep the
oxygen content below 5%. The cell leak rate as indicated by the cell
pressures or oxygen balance shall not exceed 1% of the cell volume per
day at conditions of the maximum credible accildent.

Contaimment ventilation stack fan No. 1 will be in operation with
No. 2 fan in standby. Dampers will be adjusted to maintain air flow from
less hazardous to more hazardous locatlons. All three stack filters will
be in service at all times.

The vapor-condensing system water tank will be 2/3 full, and the
pressure will be approximately atmospheric.

One cooling-tower pump will be in operation and the other in stand-
by. Each Monday the operating pump will be stopped and the standby pump
started and kept in operation for the next week. The cooling-tower fans
will be operated as needed to hold the water temperature within limits.
During freezing weather, the fans will be alternated to minimize icing
of the tower. When the ambient temperature is above freezing and only
one fan 1s required to control the water temperature, the fans will be
alternated weekly. One treated-water pump will be in operation,and the
other will be in standby. These will be alternated weekly.

The two space coolers in the reactor cell, the one in the fuel drain
tank cell, and the two in the coolant cell will be in continuous opera-
tion to maintain the temperatures in the cells below 15OOF.

Any water accumulating in the sumps of the reactor cell, drain-tank
cell, or other cells will be jetted to the waste tank. Accumulated
liquid waste will be pumped periodically to the Melton Valley waste
disposal plant.

Both radiator-duct blowers (MB 2 and MB L4) will be in operation at

all times.

One instrument air compressor and one air dryer will be in operation
and the other units in standby. Each Monday the standby air compressor
and dryer will be put into operation for the following week and the
operating compressor and dryer put in standby. One bank of 6 nitrogen
cylinders for emergency instrument air will be floating on the line with
another bank of 6 on standby.

The 125 kw ac-dc motor generator (MG&L)will be in operation. This
operates the 25 kw dc-ac motor generator (MGlO and keeps the 250v battery
bank charged. The battery bank provides emergency power for M L in
case MG 1 fails. MG L4 provides emergency power for the sampler enricher,
FOP No. 2, COP No. 2 and the 110v instrumentation.

One 48v ac-dc motor generator, MG2 or MG3, will be on line and
the other in standby. These provide UBv dc instrument power and keep
the L48v battery bank charged. The battery bank supplies emergency instru-
ment power in case both MG 2 and MG 3 fail. The MG sets will be alter-
nated weekly.

The batteries in the 250v and L8v system will be checked periodically
to assure that they are in good condition.

The diesel generators will not normally be in operation, but will be
tested periodically to assure that they are ready for operation.

A periodic operational check will be made of all safety interlocks.

The five scanners will be used to continuously monitor the system
temperatures. Scanners D and E will be set on a gain of 100and have the
reference set at 1100°F.

All process and personnel radiation monitors will be in service at
all times. Periodic checks will be made to determine that they are
operating properly.

The coolant stack will be monitored for beryllium at all times.
Beryllium sampling stations will be in service and the filtered samples
will be removed daily and checked by the industrial hygienist. One
beryllium blower will be in operation with the other in standby. These
will be alternated weekly.

The jumper board will have no jumpers not authorized by chief or
assistant chief of operations. There will be no red indicator lights on

jumper board above 1Mw operation (Run mode).

6 SAMPLING AND ADDITIONS

Various systems are sampled and analyzed periodically to determine
corrosion rate, build-up of contaminates, loss of corrosion-inhititing
chemicals, etc. Details of sampling and/or additions are given in the
following sections.

Table 6-1 lists the various samples routinely taken, giving the
normal frequency of analysis, numbering system used, and other pertinent
information. Any sample taken which does not logically fit into the
categories listed wlll be considered a miscellaneous sample and will be
numbered consecutively and preceded by an "M". (i.e. M-1, M-2, etc.)

When a sample is taken to the analytical laboratory, a "Request for
Control Analysis" form X-324 (Figure 6-1) should be filled out as com=-
pletely as possible and submitted with the sample. Cross out statement
regarding fissionable material 1f it does not apply. If rush analysis
is required on a particular analysis, this should be so indicated giving
priority if more than one rush analysis is needed. Results from rush
ahalyses will be phoned to the shift supervisor when completed. Perti-
nent information should be entered in the sample log when sample is
taken and when results are received. If results are questionable, advise

the analytical laboratory so that they can check their results.

6A TFUEL SYSTEM SAMPLING AND ENRICHING

The main parts of the sampler-enricher are: a transfer tube con-
nected to the pump bowl through which the sample capsule is lowered to
cbtain a sample, a shielded transfer box on the 852 level, a manipulator
used to handle the sample, helium supply end vacuum pumps used for purg-
ing, and the transport conatiners and transport casks. Interlocks are
provided to maintain containment and minimize harmful or dangerous
operations. A brief description of the manipulation necessary to remove
a sample or add an enrichment capsule is given in Section 6A-1 and 6A-2.
Precautions are taken to keep moisture and oxygen out of the sample and
out of the fuel system and to keep radiocactivity in. The purging neces-
sary to do this is not given in the general description but is covered
along with other details in the sampling check lists 6A-3 and 6A-lk.

The checkout and startup of the sampler-enricher after a long shutdown
is covered by 6A-5. Securing the sampler-enricher for a long shutdown
is covered by 6A-6. Unusual operating conditions are given in 6A-7.

Since sampling is potentially hazardous, two operators are required
for most of the manipulations. In general, one person reads out loud
each step in the procedure, observes the other operator as he does the
operations and then checks off the check list. Where one operator is
sufficient, this is indicated on the check lists.

1 GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF SAMPLING THE FUEL SYSTEM

Except for long shutdowns or sampler-enricher maintenance, the
sampler-enricher will be in standby condition when not in use. The
permigsive switch in the control room will be off, and the vacuum
pumps will not be running. An empty sample capsule will be hanging
on the latch in Area 1C, the operational or maintenance valve will
be closed, the accegs port will be closed, the manipulator cover
will be on, and the removal valve will be closed so that a sample
can be isolated quickly.

The first step in taking a sample is to turn the permissive
switech on. This turns on the instrument control power and permits

operation of the vacuum pump used in purging. A check is made to
 

N .

v

assure that all pressures are within limits and all valves are in -
the proper position. The operational and/or maintenance valve 1is
then opened, and the capsule is inserted into the pump bowl and

the sample withdrawn using the capsule-drive motor. When the sample
is in Area 1C, the operational or the maintenance valve is closed.

Working in the glove box near the sampler-enricher, a clean
capsule is weighed and placed in a decontaminated transport con-
tainer. The transport container ils then lowered through a trans-
port cask on top of the sampler-enricher into the removal seal area.
The removal valve is then opened and the transport container low-
ered into Area 3A. The top of the transport container is unscrewed
and then is partially withdrawn, and the removal valve is closed.
The capsule is removed from the lower part of the transport con- )
tainer and placed on the floor in Area 3A.

The access port is then opened, and the sample is removed from
the latch using the manipulator, and is placed in the bottom por-
tion of the transport contaliner in Area 3A. The empty capsule is
hung on the latch, and the access port is closed. The removal
valve is opened, the top is lowered back into Area 3A and threaded
onto the bottom of the transport container, and it is withdrawn
into the carrier cask. The removal valve 1s then closed, and the
permissive switch turned off. The transport cask is loaded onto
a truck and taken to the analytical laboratory for analysis.

A decontaminated transport container and a transport cask are
brought back to the MSRE on the return trip. The transport con-
tainer is placed in the glove box, and the cask is placed on top -
of the sampler-enricher.

2 GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF. ADDING ENRICHING CAPSULES TO THE FUEL SYSTEM

The enriching salt as received at the MSRE is in arrays of 7
samples which are in sealed cans. These are stored in an approved
safe. The safe should be locked at all times except when removing
capsules. The safe can be opened by the head of the operations
department, the MSRE engineer responsible for S5 accountability

or the ORNL shift supervisors. The engineer responsible for o0 .
Approved byv,ﬁ?22ﬂ§zaxw%¢n_ 6A-3
| V 9/8/65

accountability will take care of the preliminary preparations of
the capsules. This will consist of opening the can, weighing the
array, cutting the capsules apart, weighing each individual capsule,
and attaching a latch key to each. These will then be put back
into the safe.

When it is necessary to add a capsule to the system, written
instructions will be issued giving the capsule number to be added.
This capsule is then removed from the safe and transferred to the
glove box. After weighing, holes are drilled through the capsule
to allow the salt to drain when inserted into the fuel pump. The
capsule is then reweighed and placed in a transport container. The
sampler-enricher permissive switch is turned on, and the transport
container is lowered through a transport cask on top of the sampler
into the removal seal area. The removal valve is then opened, and
the transport container lowered into Area 3A. The top of the trans-
port container is unscrewed and then is partially withdrawn, and -
the removal valve is closed. The access port is then opened, and
the empty sampling capsule is removed from the latch and placed
in Area 3A. The enriching capsule is hung on the latch, and the
access door is closed. The operational and/or the maintenance
valve 1s opened, and the capsule is inserted into the pump bowl.
After allowing sufficient time for the salt to melt, the capsule
is withdrawn into Area 1C, and the operational or maintenance valve
is closed. The access port is then opened. The empty enricher
capsule is placed in the bottom part of the transport container,
and the empty sample capsule ig hung on the latch in Area 1C. The
access port is closed, and the removal valve is opened. The top
is threaded onto the bottom of the transport container, and it is
withdrawn into the carrier cask. The removal valve is then closed,
and the permissive switch turned off. The transport cask is loaded
onto g truck and taken to the analytical laboratory for weighing
of the empty enriching capsule. A decontaminated transport con-
tainer and a transport cask are brought to the MSRE on the return
trip. The transport container is placed in the glove box, and the

cask is placed on top of the sampler-enricher.

UNUSUAL OPERATING CONDITIONS
for the

SAMPLER-ENRICHER

During operation of the sampler-enricher, one or more of the com-
ponents may fail to operate properly. The following procedure attempts
to list the failures most likely to occur and gives operator action
to be used to overcome the difficulty. Whenever corrective action is
required, an entry should be made in the console log describing action
taken.

T.1 The access port fails to open when HS-651A is turned to "open".

7.1.1 If all six Knu-Vise operators have opened and the access port
remains closed, increase the pressure in Area 1C to about 2 psi
above the pressure in Area 3A using V-657. Should the port
still remein closed, check again for some obstruction in Area 3A
that would prevent opening.

7.1.2 If one or more of the Knu-Vise operators fail to open when
H3-651A is turned to "open', turn the switch to "closed" and
hold it for 15 sec to allow all operators to close. Walt about
2 minutes for the pressure in line 650 to build up through
FE-650D. Then, turn HS-651A to "open" again. If the operators
still fail to open, gently push the knob on the center pin of
the operator linkage which remained closed with the manipulator
while holding HS-651A at "open". The operator should open
easily.

7.1.3 If all six operators fail to open, check that all interlock
circuits are satisfied: '"removal valve closed" light on,
"operational or maintenance valve closed" light on, "1C pressure
greater than 3A" alarm off, and fuel-pump bowl pressure 1s less
than 10 psig. Next, check that PI-650B indicates at least
75 psig. Check that HSV-651A, 6524, and 653A function properly.
Failure of any of these to seat or to open properly will cause
a malfunction of the operators. Also check that HSV-675A1 is

open.

The access port fails to close when HS-651A is turned toc "close".

PI-650B indicates at least 75 psig, HSV-651A, 6524, and 653A
are seating and opening properly, HSV-675A1 is open, and there
are no obstructions in the way.

The access port buffer pressure fails to increase properly when the

access port is closed.

7.3.1 If the buffer pressure fails to ilncrease properly, turn
H3-651A to "close" and hold for 15 sec to seal any operators
that had failed to lock shut.

T7.3.2 If step 7.3.1 fails to correct the difficulty, open the access .
port and check for dirt or damage on the sealing surface on the
gaskets.

Removal valve fails to open or close.

T.4.1 If the removal valve fails to open when HS-RV-A is turned to
open, check that all interlocks are satisfied: 'removal seal
buffer pressure’ light on, "access port closed" light on, and
"operational or maintenance valve closed" light on. If the
interlocks are satisfied, check the HCV-RV-Al and HCV-RV-A2
are cperating properly. A flow of air from the vent port :
indicates a valve failure. Another possible cause of trouble
would be slipping of the air operator on the valve body.
Failure of the limit switches would indicate improper valve
operation when it is actually working satisfactorily. >

T.4.2 TIf the valve fails to close properly, check for an obstruction
in the valve,

The buffer gas pressure to the maintenance or the operational valve

decreases slowly during standby.

7.5.1 The pressure should bleed down only if the supply is blocked.

nance valves close upon receiving high radiation in the sampler

buttons $-113 and/or S-114. If the radiation level is low this

will reopen the valves. If the FP bowl pressure is high, the

pressure receding below 1C psig will automatically reopen the
valves,

Failure of the manipulator-boct buffer to hold a vacuum indicates
a leak in the buffer system. If all tubing fittings are leak tight,
one or both boots have a hole and must be replaced.

High radiation in the contaimment areas which will be detected
by RE-6T75A and RE-675RB indicates a release of gaseous activity to the
building ventilation system. Block valves on all sources of gaseous
activity close when either element trips. The following valves
close: HSV-6T78A; HSV-6T78B2; HSV-67TA; ESV-5L2A; HSV-675A; HSV-659B;
HSV-65TD; HSV-668B; and HSV-655B. To determine the source of activity,
close the hand switches controlling each of these valves. When the
radiation level area LA decreases sufficiently, reset the circuits
using S-113 and S-114. ILights 1A-377 and 1B-377 must be on. Then
open each possible source of activity ocne at a time walting to see
if that was the one. A suggested order to use is HS-668B which opens
H3V-668B, HSV-655B, HSV-657D, and HSV-657D, then HS-6T75A, HS-659B,
H3-5L42A, and HS-675A. HS-6T78B and HS-6T77 should be opened oae &t
a time with HS-678A closed. Corrective action will be determined

by the source of activity.

6B COOLANT SYSTEM SAMPLING

The coolant sampler is designed to allow sampling without contami-
nating the salt with moisture or oxygen or endangering personnel due
to beryllium release. The primary components of the coolant sampler
are: a glove box located above the coolant cell, a transfer tube
connected to the coolant pump bowl, helium supply and vacuum pumps to
be used for purging, and a sample carrier which attaches to the top of
the glove box for inserting empty capsules and extracting full capsules.

Interlocks are provided to minimize dangerous operations. The
interlocking system is a "key interlock"” system in which one key must
be inserted and turned before the key necessary for the next operation
can be removed. The keys and locks are color coded to aid the operator.

A brief description of the manipulations necessary to remove a
sample is given in Section H6A 1. Purging operations which are utilized
are not covered in this description but are given in detail in the
sampling check list 6A 2. Startup of the coolant sampler is covered in
startup check list 6B 3, and shutdown of the coolant sampler for a sus-
tained duration is covered in 6B k.

Since cooclant sampling is considerably less hazardous than fuel
sampling, one operator is considered sufficient for normal coolant
sampling operations.

1 GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF SAMPLING THE COOLANT SYSTEM
Except for long reactor shutdowns or sampler maintenance,

the coolant sampler will be in standby condition when not in use.

The key which must be used to start the sampling operations will

be in a lock switch on the main countrol board. An empty capsule

will be hanging on the latch in the glove box. The glove port
access will be locked closed, and the vacuum pump and light will
be turned off.

At the start of the sampling operation, the key is removed
from the main bocard. At the coolant sampler, a check is made to
insure that pressures and valves are set properly to start the

sampling. Lights and vacuum pump are turned on.
Approved byfggﬁ;ji%gzgéﬁg/dgggw\k 6B-2
W/ 9/29/65

A clean, empty capsule is weighed in the dry box (near the
sampler-enricher). The capsule is placed in the sample carrier
and taken to the coolant sampler. It is then attached to the top
of the glove box.

The key which was removed from the control room is inserted
in the proper lock (the only one it will fit). Unlocking this
lock allows the removal of a key which is necessary in the next
cperation.

Using the key interlock system, valves are opened which con-
nect the pump bowl to the glove box. The empty capsule is lowered
into the pump bowl, a sample is obtained, and the salt-filled
capsule is withdrawn into the glove box. The valves opening into
the pump bowl are closed.

When the sample is isolated in the glove box, the glove port
access 1is opened. The empty capsule in the sample carrier atop
the glove box is inserted into the glove box. Using the glove
the operator switches places with the empty and full capsules.
The full capsule is then pulled into the sample carrier and the
valves are closed to isolate it. The glove part is relocked and
the coolant pump sampler is prepared for standby conditions.

The sample carrier with the full sample is taken to analytic
chemistry and the sample removed from the carrier. The carrier is

returned to the MSRE ares so it may be utilized again when needed.

6C WATER SYSTEM

The water system is sampled and analyzed as listed in Table 6-1 to
assure that the proper concentration of chemicals are present for corrosion
protection. The sample lines should be flushed before each sample 1s
taken. Use one-pint or 2 sample-line volumes (whichever is largest).

Due to possible induced activity, the treated water and nuclear penetra-
tion water should be handled as contaminated waste. The sample points

are located as follows:

Treated Water System V-8268 Diesel House
Nuclear Instrument Penetration V-8L48F High Bay
Tower Water V-829D Diegsel House
Process Water V-890D Cocling Tower
CST-1 V-CST-1A Water Room
CoST-2 V-CST-2A Water Room

The analytical procedures to be used by the MSRE operators are

described in the following sections:

Total Inhibitor - Section 6C-k

If total hardness is greater than 2 x total
hardness of raw water, increase blowdown from
tower basin to maintain a ratio near 2:1.

If pH, or Fe are out of limits when hardness
is within limits, notify the responsible
chemist (Paul Neumann or Roy Thoma). The
process water analysis is used as a gulide for

CTW limits.

 

 

Check cooling tower for algae. If algae are
present as indicated by green growth on cooling

tower, add one ball of Nalco No. 215 to basin.

 

3 CONDENSATE

Condensate samples should be analyzed before
use., If the total hardness exceeds the 1limit,
the tank should be drained. The gource of

6D CELL AIR

During nuclear operations the in-cell atmosphere will be controlled
to give it a low Oz content, 5% by volume or less. A continuous oxygen
analyzer is installed to determine the Oz content. To check the analyzer
and to determine the type of activity in case of accidents, the cell air
will be sampled periodically. The sample station is located in the vent
house and is a part of lines 569 and 565. A portable sample bomb with
a valve at each end will be used to take the semple. The details of
sampling are given below.

6E LUBE OIl, SYSTEM

1 SAMPLING OF NEW OIL AS RECEIVED
The lubricating oil (Gulfspin 35) for both the fuel and coolant
systems will be sampled (~ 500 ml per sample) on arrival at MSRE.

 

Before use each drum of oil will be analyzed chemically for carbon,
sulfur, bromine number, acid number, flash point, and moisture;
viscosity determinations will be made at 100°F and 210°F. Inter-
facial tension of the oil will be determined at TTOF. Also spec-
trographic and infrared spectrophotometric analyses will be made
before approval for use is given by the operations chief. Each
drum will be tagged with a waterproof covered tag showing identi-
fication, sample number, analysis, certification and current inven-
tory. The o0il will be stored in the Flammable Materials Storage
Building, west of the offgas vent stack.

The acid number (a measure of the oxidation inhibition in the
0il) and the interfacial tension at 77°F will be determined on a
weekly basis during power operations whereas the remainder of the
zanalyses listed above will be made annually or when required.

2 SAMPLING AT OLL PACKAGES
The lube oil in the fuel and coolant system will be sampled

 

weekly during power operation into 250 ml bottles from V-703D
and V-753D. (depleting each oil system ~ 3 gal~yr). In the event
of radiocactive contamination of the lube o0il, the entire lube oil
package will be shielded with lead bricks. The oll will be sampled
with HP surveillance into an evacuated metal container equipped
with an autoclave fitting and a compound gage. The valves, auto-
clave fittings, and sample container may require extended handles
or additional shielding for the sampling operation. Details of
procedure are given below.

7. HEAT BATANCE

Heat balances will be taken periodically to determine the thermal
power that is generated by the reactor. The heat balance results will
be used to keep a close check on the calibration of more direct methods
of power indication, i.e. flow times AT of the coolant salt, and the

various neutron level instruments.
  

7 l TA-1

Approved by .~ 3

TA  GENERAL DESCRIPTION

The heat balance will be made by considering the walls of the Re-
actor and Drain Tank Cells as an envelope into which heat is added or
from which heat is taken. The net heat removal, whether positive or
negative, represents the thermal power of the reactor. Terms 1in the
heat balance, either heat scurces or heat sinks, may vary from a few
watts, as is the case with control rod drive motors, to ~ 10 megawatts
which may be removed by the coolant salt at full power. The terms are
many and varied in value so only the most significant ones are calcu-
lated, i.e. those greater than about 5 to 10 kilowatts. There are other
terms, especially heat sink terms, which cannot be measured directly,
i.e. heat losses through the cell walls to the earth, concrete, etc.
The terms that are not evaluated individually will be evaluated
collective-ly as a single correction term which will be called
"heat losses."
There will be a total of nine terms to be evaluated for the heat
balance. These terms will be listed here and described later. Heat
sink terms will be:
1. Heat removal from the reactor cell by the coolant salt,
0.1 - 10 Mw. (Computer notation QCSRC)

D, Heat removal by cooling water (treated), 0.1 — 0.5 Mw.
(Computer notation QCWT)

3. Heat removal by comporent cooling air, 0.02 — 0.06 Mw.
( Computer notation QCCA)

L. Heat removal by fuel pump oll system, both lube and shield

cooling, 0.005 — 0.01 Mw. (Computer notation QFPY)

5. Heat losseg, this will be a collection of unevaluated terms

which will be used as a correction term for the overall heat

balance, -0.1 — 0.5 Mw. (Computer notation QL¥S)
Approved by :;2%§%%;7}4&ﬂm? | TA-2

Heat Source terms will be:

(Computer notation PFE) |

2. Total power added by electric heaters, 0.0 - 0.2 Mw.

Heat Balance Terms

1.1 Heat Removed by the Coolant Salt. At any significant power
this will be the largest and therefore the most important term
in the heat balance calculation. Since this is true, consider-
able effort has been made to provide reliable and precise
instrumentation for the measurement of this term. Thermo-
couples located in wells at the inlet and outlet of the radiator
will be used to calculate average radiator inlet (ARAIT) and
average radiator outlet (ARAQT) temperatures. A venturi flow
meter is located just upstream of the radiator; information
from this device will be used in the calculation of the coolant
flow rate. Knowing the heat capacity of the salt, the flow
rate, and the temperature difference across the radiator, the
total heat removed at the radiator may be calculated.

1.2 Heat Removed by Ccoling Water. Five significant heat sinks
are included in this term. They comprise heat removed by
cooling water from:

Drain-Tank-Cell Air Cooler (DICAC),

Reactor-Cell Air Cooler #1 (RCAC1),

Reactor-Cell Air Cooler #2 (RCAC2),

Fuel-Pump Motor Cooler (FPMC) and

5.  Thermal Shield (TS¢).

In each of these five cases the temperature rise of the cooling

= w N

water is measured, the cooling weter flow rate is set and assumed
+ -

 

mapry TA-3
8/L/65

to remain constant. Knowing these quantities the heat removal may

be calculated.

1.3

1.4

Heat Removed by Component Cocling Air. Energy is removed from

 

the component cooling air both by the reduction of the gas
stream temperature and by the work done compressing the gas.
Since this is true, not ouly must the temperature change and
the flow rate of gas be determined, but also the change in
pressure which takes place across the compressor. By using
the cooling water AT and flow rate and the gas stream AT the
gas flow rate is established. Now using the gas flow rate Fg,
the absoclute gas outlet temperature T, the temperature dif-
ference between the cell alr and the gas outlet A é, the

cell pressure P,, the pressure rise across the compressor AP,

and the constants, heat capacity of the gas C the universal

pg’
gas constant R, and the molecular weight of the cell gas M,
the total heat removed may be calculated by the following
equation:

R

t * C
Q=TFg (Cpg AT + 3y T In—p— )

Heat Removed by the Fuel Q0il System. The flow rate and temperea-

 

ture rise for the Iube 01l stream and the Shield Cooling oil
stream are measured. The heat removal by the oil stream 1s
calculated, assuming that the heat capacity for oll is a
constant. The heat removed by the two cll streams ie calcu-

lated separately and the results are then combined.

Heat Losses. At a time when the system is hot and circulating

but no power is being produced an evaluation of the heat-loss
term can be made. This may be accomplished by measuring the
energy added to the envelope by heaters, fuel circulating
pump, space cooler motors, etc., and the energy removed by
cooling water, coolant salt, cooling oil, codling air, etec.;

the differerce between these two energy tabulations will be the
Approved bx@% o TA-1
. 8/ /65

term in question. This term will be evaluated several times
both before and after power operation has begun. By the time
this measurement hags been made several times the value should
be known with geood statistical confidence.

1.6 Heat Added by ‘the Fuel Pump Motor. The power that is required

 

by the fuel pump will contribute to the total heat in the
reactor cell. This quantity may be read_directly from the
fuel pump watt meter, E M-FPD.

1.7 Heat Added by the Electric Heaters. The total heat inpat to
the Reactor and Drain Tank Cells and to the coolant salt loop
outside the Reactor Cell will be taken into accourt in & heat
balance. A value for this heat source will be obtained by
tabulating the current drawn by the heaters that are in service.
Any changes in heater settings or in heaters in or out of
service will affect the heat balance results. In general,
this will be considered as a constant with a correction for
variation in line voltage.

1.8 Heat Added by the Coolant Pump. Only that heat which is intro-

 

duced to the coolant salt as work will be considered. The
power that is used by the coolant pump will be read from
EﬁM—CPD. come fraction of this value will be used. The value
of the fraction will be established.

1.9 Heat Added by the Space Coclers. The heat that is added to the

 

system by the space cooler motors (3) will be determined by
measuring the power reguired under normal conditions, for the
operation of each motor. This will be done by using a "clamp-
on" ammeter to measure the current. This will be done several
times to establish the power, then the value will be rechecked

periodicaily.

18) Safety channel #3 (NFFS3)

2. Requested Calculation.

 

A heat balance may be requested at any time and as often as

one might wish to do so. The requested heat balance will not

interfere with the calculation of the routine heat balance. The
Approved b vy It 7 f TB-2
8/4/65

results of the requested heat balance will consist of two lines ¢
of data, without identifiers, on typer number 3. The first line
will have the same order and content as listed above under "Routine
Calculation"”, the second line will include, in the order stated,
the following:

19) Radiator inlet AT (difference between two thermocouples in

the same well)
20) Radiastor outlet AT {(difference between two thermocouples
in the same well)

21)  Heat removed by drain-tank-cell air cooler

22)  Heat removed by reactor-cell air cooler #1

23)  Heat removed by reactor-cell air cooler #2

2Lk)  Heat removed by fuel pump motor cooler .

25)  Heat removed by thermal shield cooler

26)  Component-cooling-air flow rate

27)  Heat removed by fuel-pump lube oil

28) Heat removed by fuel-pump shield cooling oil

29) Radiator air flow rate

30) Heat added by electric heaters

31) Heat added by fuel circulating pump

32)  Heat added by cell air cooler motors

33) Heat added by coolant circulating pump

34)  Heat lost from the Reactor and drain tank cells.

3. Operator Regulrements.

The computer will read many variables for each heat balance
and use these wvariables together with constants that have been
established to complete the calculation. Many of the constants
that are used for the computer calculation are controllable by the
reactor operators, for example: the various treated cooling water
flow rates are assumed by the computer to be set at gome constant
value, in reality this value may drift or be changed by an ocperator

thus yielding an erroneous result. .
Approved by% 257 TB-3
8/1/65

The following 1s a list of flow rates that are assumed by the

computer (these will be modified if the operating conditions

change. ) :
FIA-836 60 gpm
FIA-8L0 60 gpm
FIA-838 60 gpm
FIA-830 > gpm
FT -8L4L 60 gpm
FI -873 20 gpm

The computer also assumes that some constant amount of power
is being added by heaters. If a heater fails or if heater current
settings are changed then the power added by the heaters changes
and an erroneous heat balance results. The total power added to the
system by heaters will be about 200 kw.

The computer also assumes that all three cell air coolers are
in operation. Thege should be checked "on".

Routine heat balances are calculated six times daily beginning
at 0230 and every 4 hours thereafter. The operator must check and
if necessary adjust water flows approximately 15 minutes before the
heat balance is made. He must also note if any heater settings

have been changed and if any of the cell air coolers are off.

7C MANUAL HEAT BALANCE

Manual calculation of heat balances will be done to check out the
operation of the computer. It may also be necessary to make several
manual heat balances during the zero power experiments since the computer
may not be in full operation by that time. The calculations necessary
are identical to those done by the computer, those calculations are
described in the "Computer Systems Report.” The part of the manual
heat balance that has the greatest importance to the operator is the
taking of data necegsary for its calculation. The following list is to

be used for collecting this data.

8 PERIODIC INSTRUMENT CALIBRATION
AND
CIRCUIT CHECKS

During each startup of the MSRE the instrumentation will be tested
to assure that it is functioning properly as described in Section LH.
These startup tests will include a thorough checkout of all instrumen-
tation and circuitry. Due to the importance of some instruments or
circuits, they will also be tested periodically during operation.
Details of these tests are given in the following section. The frequency
of testing is given in Table 8-1.

If the tests indicate that the instrumentation has failed in an
unsafe manner, consideration should be given to manually actuating the
safety action. In the case of 2 out of 3 circuitry,this will not in-
terfere with normal operation. It will require extra steps during the
testing of the other two channels. 1In the case of one out of two
channels, it may be possible to increase the frequency of testing of
the other channel and using other administrative controls. In most

cases the operations chief should be consulted.

8A NEUTRON LEVEL

Due to the complexity of the nuclear instrumentation and the
possibility of it drifting, all components are given periodic on line
tests. These tests as described in this section are done mainly by
instrument technicians; however, operational personnel should follow
the work closely. No jumpers should be installed without the prior
approval of the operations chief.

Obtain Shift Supervisor's permission before starting this procedure

1 WIDE RANGE COUNTING CHANNELS

Since only one counting channel is required,

 

the following tests can be performed on a single
channel while the reactor is in service. The
other channel should be in service before starting
this check if reactor power is less than 1 Mw.

1.1 Reference Voltages Channel 1

 

Measure all DC voltages with a digital
voltmeter at the tests points indicated. If
adjustments are required, follow the procedure
given in the individual module manual. The
regulated supply voltages should be adjusted
only when measured in drawer W-2 (RX-NCC 1-AL).

8B CALIBRATION CHECK
OF
PROCESS RADIATION MONITORS

INTRODUCTION

It will be necessary to check periodically the calibration of the
process radiation monitors and associated equipment to insure their
reliability for the protection of personnel and as a warning system of
radioactive escape. Two methods are used for checking this system.

One method 1s a frequent check of the readout instruments, and the other
is a check of the entire system using a known gource.

A finite reading on the readout instruments, from both the G-M
tubes and ion chambers, is usually an indication that the system is
operating properly. The readings of these instruments are checked
periodically as well as the calibration of the G-M tubes and the zero
on the electrometers. |

The system check-out using a source will consist of removing a plug
from the shield around the detectors, inserting a source, and checking
that the appropriate readings and alarms are received. Details are
given below. Frequency of testing is given in Table 8-1.

Init. Date/Time

 

1 PREPARATION

1.1 Obtain permission from shift supervisor to

 

test calibration of process radiation equip-

ment. Shift Supervisor's initials

 

1:2 Check and adjust if necessary the calibrate and
alarm setpoints on all radiation monitors

(Q-1916-1R3).

 

1.3 Obtain source in lead carrier from instrument
shop. Read the specifications carefully.
The source is Uobalt-60 which has & half-life
of ~ 5 1/3 years.

 

1.4 Estabiish communications between Auxillary

9 UNUSUAL OPERATING CONDITIONS

During operation difficulties of various kinds and severity may be
encountered. To plan in advance for all possible troubles would be im-
practical. In this section an attempt is made to anticipate some of the
more probable or more serious ones; and suggest remedial actions,
Conditions at the time may alter the a&otion to be taken. In some cases
it may be possible to instigate strict administrative control as a substi-
tute for control or even safety interlocks. 1In this case it will usually
be desirable to consult the Operations Chief.

The sections are written as check lists to a&id in recording the
action taken. However they need not be filled out until the situation
is under controil.

A1l personnel should be thoroughly familiar with the suggested

corrective action.

9A LOSS OF ELECTRICAL POWER

Various degrees of loss of electrical power are possible atv the
MSRE. The operator actions required and control actions which will
occur are given in the sections below.

1 1,055 OF PREFERRED TVA FEEDER

 

If power is lost on the preferred feeder (line 23k4) the motor-
operated pole-line switch No. 129 will open. Following a 6-second
delay the alternate feeder (line 294) motor-operated pole-line
switeh No. 229 will close and power will be resumed. It wiil be
necessary to restart some of the equipment as described in section
3A 3.1. After this, operation can continue until voltage return
on the preferred feeder. To avoid overloading the alternate feeder,
the radiator blowers should not be operated at this time.

2 COMPLETE LOSS OF TVA POWER - ALL DIESELS OPERABLE

 

If power is lost on both TVA feeders, the two motor-operated
pole-line switches (No. 129 and 229) will open. The operator should
proceed ag follows:

Tnit. Date/Time

 

2.1 Start all three diesel generators and restart
the egquipment asg given in section 3A 3.2. The
radiator blowers cannot be operated on the
generators. The scanners, chart drives and
control room clock will be automatically
transferred to motor generator L.

2.2 Continue operation at heat loss power or lower
until the voltage from the 250v battery bank
drops below acceptable limits. At which time,
the fuel and coolant systems should be drained,
and if necessary, the afterheat removal system
rut into service. o

2.2 Since the life expectancy of the 250v batteries

is approximately 2 hours, reduce all unnecessary

load-

and COP-1. This will transfer 4-8kw to
the diesel generator.

(Outside Battery Room)

2.3.2 Open the 250 VDC light breaker in the
250v distribution panel. This will remove
the emergency DC lights from the batteries.
This amounts to approximately 4 kw. (4
portable battery operated light should be
in the control room at this time.) L

3 FAITURE OF DIESEL GENERATOR NO. 3 DURING A TVA POWER
CUTAGE

If diesel generator No. 3 cannot be started

 

or fails during operation, the operator should pro-
ceed as follows:
(Outside Battery Room)
3.1 The fuel and coolant pumps will not be operable.
Refer to sectlion 9C for details of operation.
3.2 Close the 250v Dc light breaker in the 250v
digtribution panel to supply emergency Dc
lighting if lights are not already on.
(Main Control Room)
3.3 Check that FOP-2 is in operation. (FOP-1 can-
not be operated unless diesel generator No. 3
hag power. )
3.4 Stop COP-2 and start COP-1. This will conserve
250v battery life.
3.5 Where alternate equipmenf 1s powered by both

diesel generator No. 3 and No. L, start the
equipment on diesel generator No. 4 (Sec. 34,
Table VI).

Check that the drain-tank space-cooler DCC
transfer switch (located near entrance to

M G room) is set to MCC-GL. Restart DCC

if necessary.

Since component coolant pump No. 3 will not
be operable, emergency alr from the auxiliary
air compressor will be needed to keep FV-204
and 206 frozen asg well as fuel processing

freeze valves if they are not deep frozen.

3.7.2 Open V-967A.

3.7.3 Set PCV-967 to & psig.

Since one of the reactor cell space coolers
(RCC 1) will not be in operation, the cell

 

 

temperature will increase with resulting
increase in pressure. Operator should

proceed as follows:

(Water Room)

3.8.1 Close V-838A to shut off the water
flow to RCC 1.

3.8.2 Open V-840A, V-836A and V-8T73A to
give maximum water flow to RCC 2 and
DCC and the component coolant heat

exchanger.

(Vent House)

3.8.3 If the cell pressure increases due 10
the temperature rise, increase the rate
of evacuation by opening V-560A and
V-569B or V-565C to control pressure at
12.7 psia.

No. 3 is in operation, RCC-1 can be put back in service.
The water flow (V-8384) should be increased gradually

in order to avoid pulling too high a vacuum on the cell.
Flow to RCC 2, DCC and component coolant heat exchanger
should be decreased to normal flow rate (V-840A, 836A and
873-4).

3.9 When the voltage from the 250v battery drops
to 212v or the cell air temperature rises to
200 degrees F, the fuel and cooclant systems
should be drained.

3.10 One of the tower fang, TF 1, will not be in
operation. During periods of high heat locad
during the summer this could increase the
cooling tower water temperature and subse-
quently heat the treated water. All equip-
ment should be watched for overheating.

L FAITLURE OF DIESEL GENERATOR NO. 4 DURING A TVA POWER

OUTAGE
If diesel generator No. 4 cannot be started

or fails during operation, the operator should

proceed ag follows:

(Main Control Room)

L.l The fuel pump will not be operable. Refer to
section 9C for details of operation.

4.2 Check that COP-2 is in operation (COP-1 can-
not be operated unless diesel generator buss
No. 4 has power.). .

L.3 Stop FOP~2 and start FOP-1. This will conserve
250v battery life.

4.6 Since one of reactor cell coolers (RC-2) will
not be in operation, the cell temperature will
increase with a resulting increase in pressure.
The operator should proceed as follows:

(Water Room)
L.6.1 Close V-84CA to shut off water to RCO-2.
4.6.2 Cpen V-838A, V-83€4, and V-8734 to give
a maximum flow to RCC-1, DCC and component
coolant heat exchanger.
h.6.3 If the cell bressure lncreases due to
the temperature rise, increase the rate
of cell evacuvation by opening V-5694 ard
V-569B or V-565C to conbrol pressure at
1Z2.7 psia. .
NOTE: When TVA power is resumed or when diesel generator
No. 4 is in operation, RCZ-2 can be put back in service.
The water flow (V-840A) should be throttled and increased
gradually to avoid pulling too high a vacuum on the cell.
Flow to RCC-1, DCC and component cooling heat exchanger
should be decreased to the normal flow rate (V-8384, V-8364
and V-8734).

4.7 When the 250v battery drops to 212v or the cell
alr temperature rises to 200 degrees F, the
fuel and coolant systems should be drained.

5 FAILURE OF DIESEL GENERATOR NO. 5 DURING A TVA
POWER OUTAGE

 

This diesel furnishes all emergency electrical
heat to the process system. Continued operation
on emergency power without diesel generator No. 5
would endanger the ability to drain the system by
cooling the thawed FV in the reactor system drain
line and FV's in the coolant system.
The operator should proceed as follows:
5.1 If diesel generator No. 5 cannot be started
within two minutes after a power outage,
switch FV-103, FV-204, and FV-206 to thaw.

5.2 Continue to try and start diesel generator

 

No. 5. If diesel generator No. 5 starts or

TVA power is regained before the drain begins,

freeze FV-204, 206 and 103 and resume operation.

5.3 Bince the life expectancy of the 250v
batteries is approximately 2 hours, reduce
all unnecessary load.
(Main Control Room)

5.3.1 Stop FOP-2 and COP-2 and start FOP-1
and COP-1. This will transfer 4-8 kw to
the diesel generator.

(Outside Battery Room)

5.3.2 Open the 250v Dc light breaker in the
250v distribution panel. This will remove
the emergency Dc lights from the batteries.
This amounts to approximately U kw.

otart standby pump.

Determine reason for failure of first pump. Put repair request

on punch list or proceed to get punp back in service,

If both treated water pumps are out of service, take necessary

steps to repair the less damaged one as soon as possible.

Determine time needed for repairs and proceed tc protect the

equipment listed below within the time 1imit specified.

1.k,

1.k

1 Fuel Pump and Coolant Pump Motors can be run without
cooling for ~ 10-15 minutes. After this time the flow switch
will stop the pumps. Keep a check on system temperatures

and drain systems 1f freezing appears to be possible.

.2 Reactor Cell and Drain Tank Cell Space Coolers can be

without water for ~ 20 minutes before the cell temperature
reaches 200 degrees F. During this period the cell can be
kept below atmospheric pressure by evacuating through L-569
or L-565. When cell reaches 200 degrees F drain the system
and turn off all heaters in RC and DIC. Close V-836A,
V-838A, V-8LOA. Do not allow salt to freeze in the drain

or flush tanks. Periodically turn on heaters or transfer
salt to the fuel storage tank if necessary. When water flow
is restarted, throttle flow to the space coolers and put

one cooler in service at a time fto prevent over-evacuating
the cells. Increase nitrogen purge and if necessary to avoid
evacuating cell below 10 psia add air to the cells through
sump Jjet supply. Keep discharge from Jjets closed. Stop

cell evacuation until cell temperature returns to normal.

1.4.3 Thermal Shield water can be off ~ 110 minutes at full
power or 270 minutes at zero power before boiling starts.
If at power take the reactor subcritical. If water flow
cannot be restored within time limit, drain the system and
shut off heaters in reactor cell.

1.5 Radiation Block

 

Radiation in the cooling water would block all flow to the RC
and DIC equipment. The operator should proceed as follows:
1.5.1 Take reactor to heat loss power.

1.5.2 Determine which water line contains the source of
radiation. Isolate this system by closing hand valves in
the supply and discharge lines.

1.5.3 Reset RIA 827 and FSV-84LAL to allow block valves to open
and restore circulation to other equipment.

1.5.4 Observe time limits in step 1.4 to various equipment for
continued operation.

2 COOLING TOWER WATER

Although the cooling tower water is less critical than the treated

water, certain equipment cannot be kept in coperation after loss of

cooling tower water flow. Therefore both pumps should be kept in
good operating condition. On loss of flow the operator should pro-
ceed as follows:

2.1 On loss of one pump, the stand-by pump should be started
immediately. As soon as possible repairs should be made to the
damaged pump.

2.2 On loss of both pumps determine the time needed for repairs.
Based on the repair time, proceed as follows:

2.2.1 Check and adjust water flow to Drain Tank Condensers,
V-810 and V-812 in water room. (Transfer to process water
is automatic.)

2.2.2 Manually transfer instrument air compressor to process

water. Close V-880 and open V-872 in Diesel House.

9D LOSS OF INSTRUMENT AIR

The instrument air system consists of an operating Joy Compressor

and a stand-by unit which starts automatically on low supply pressure.

On loss of both instrument alr compressors, the service alr compressor

can be manually put on stream. If it should alsc fail, two banks of

nitrogen cylinders with a capacity of 20 to 30 minutes will supply gas

to critical pneumatic instruments.

1 AIR COMPRESSOR ELECTRICAL DLEFFICULITIES

 

The electrical power for AC No. 1 is from MCC-G3 (TVA or DG3)

and for AC No. 2 is from Bus MCC-Gh (TVA or D64). The control

power is normally Tfrom IPP2 {MGh) but is transferred to MCC-GU

(TVA or DG4) on loss of Mi4. Loss of either primary power or

control power wilil stop the compressors.

After momentary loss of power, restart the

degired air compressor.

 

If only DGk is operating, start AC No. 2.
If only DG3 is operating, start AC No. 1.

to supply nitrogen to the emergency air

header.

 

2.4.2 Change cylinders as reguired until
reactor has been drained. .
3 EFFECTS OF LOSS OF INSTRUMENT AIR

Logss of instrument air will initiate a drain

 

 

by closing the air valves which keep FV's 104,
105 and 106 frozen (FV 104 iz deep frozen during
normal operation.). In addition to this,air-
operated valves will go to their fail position,
all air line block valves will close, and the
pneumatic instruments will not function. This
will include weigh cells, cell sump level indi-
cators' pressure controller and some cooling
water flow indicators. The operator should

take the following steps to assure a drain
before salt freezes. .

3.1 Scram the rods.

 

3.2 PHwitch to emergency drain.

3.3 Increase the heat on FV 103, 204 and

 

206 if necessary.
3.4 If FV 103, 204, or 206 do not thaw, turn
off CCP No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3.

OE RADIATTION INCREASES

Due to the hazardous nature of radiation, any radiation increases

should be given prompt and careful consideration, and if necessary, action

taken to insure that no harm is incurred by personnel. The following

procedure will attempt to guide the operating personnel in case of high

and/or increasing radiation as indicated on the personnel monitors, pro-

cess radiation monitors, and stack monitors.

PERSONNEL MONITORS

1

 

The handling of radiation ilncreases is described in the Safety

Procedures and Emergency Plans (Part IX of Design and Operations

Report). The general philosophy to be followed is given below.

Init. Date/Time

 

1.1 The person discovering a high and/or increasing

1.3

radiation field should:
1.1.1 Bvacuate personnel from the immediate

area.

 

1.1.2 Take any local action which would

alleviate the hazard.

 

1.1.3 Notify the control room as rapidly as

possible.

 

The control room operator upon receiving noti-
fication of high and/or increasing radiation
should:

1.2.1 Notify the shift supervisor and other

members of the local emergency sguad.

 

1.2.2 Maintain control of the reactor, making
changes in operation as required by the

situation.

 

1.2.3 Take any other action necessary to
insure personnel safety (such as actuating

the evacuation alarm).

 

The shift supervisor should:

1.3.1 Direct the efforts of all operating

personnel to determine the source of
activity, prevent the spread of con-
tamination and/or reduce the intensity

or ares of the radiation zone.

 

1.3.2 BSet up contamination and radiation
zones immediately. 1f entry is necessary,
a change area should be established with
clear instructions posted describing in
detall what percautions are necessary,
where the contamination zone ends and the

clean area begins.

 

1.3.3 Direct the cleanup operations.

 

2 PROCESS RADIATION DETECTORS
2.1 RM-827 (Treated Water) (2 out of 3 monitors

 

 

causes control action. )

 

A rapid large increase in treated water
activity would probably be caused by a major
component failure in-cell. In case of treated
water activibty increase, the operator should
proceed as follows:

2.1l.1 Evacuate non-coperating personnel from

the water room. Use the P. A. System.

 

2.1.2 Try resetting the instruments. This
would correct the problem if it were
caused by an instrument power surge. 1f
poseible have instrument mechanic check

the instrument.

 

NOTE: Electrometers will not indicate above the alarm
set point. Therefore, to determine the actual radiation
level, change to a less sensitive scale and push the

reset button.

2.1.3 Check other process radiation monitors.
In case of a major in-cell release, RM-565
(cell offgas) should respond. Personnel
monitors (cams and monitrons) may also
show increases. Check the FP level. A

system leak might be seen here.

 

2.1.4 If other radiation monitors show sig-
nificant increases, see the section of
this procedvre which deals with the

. monitor of interest.

 

- 2.1.5 After these preliminary actions are
. taken, refer to Procedure 9B, Step 1.5,
which gives operator action for a radia-

tion block of water to in-cell components.

 

2.2 RM-565 (Cell Air) (1 out of 2 monitors causes

 

control action.)

 

Any large changes in radiation in the cell
could be reflected by small changes in the cell
. offgas activity. (Note that changes in power
should only produce glight changes in cell air
" activity.)
Any fast or large increases of activity
20 mr/hr) in the offgas may be a sign of
serious component failure. The operator should
proceed as follows:
2.2.1 Initiate an emergency drain if the con-

trol circuits have failed to do this.

 

2.2.2 Actuate the evacuation horn to remove

non-cperating personnel from the area.

 

2.2.3 1If possible have an instrument mechanic

. check the instrument.

 

2.2.4 If the instrument is at fault and can

be corrected quickly, try to reset the

alarms and stop the drain. If it is
truly radiation, allow the system to

drain.

 

2.2.5 Make any steps possible to reduce
the leakage such as reducing the pres-
sure on various components or stopping

the fuel pump.

 

2.2.6 Take data which might be used in
determining the location of the leak
such as levels, welghts, effects of
pressure changes, etc.

2.2.( When the system indicates that it

 

has drained, switch the freeze valves
1o freeze. Any action beyond this
point will have to be determined at
the time and will depend upon the
situation,

RM-528 (Coolant System Offgas) (1 out of 2

causes control action.)

 

 

Significant increases in coolant offgas
activity (>20 mr/hr) would probably be
caused by a leak in the primary heat exchanger.
Activity in the coolant offgas should automat-
ically give an emergency drain and stop the
fuel pump.

Upon notification of coolant offgas activ-
ity, the operator should proceed as follows:
2.3.1 Check that an "emergency fuel drain”

has been initiated and the fuel pump

stopped. If not, the operator should

instigate these actions.

 

2.3.2 Drain the coolant system after the

fuel system has drained.

the time of the incident. The next
actions would probably be concerned with
checking the heat exchanger for a leak.
A method which might be used for this
would be to pressurize the coolant sys-
tems and watch for pressure buildup in

the fuel system.

RM-500 (Main Felium Supply) (Alarms Only)

Activity in the line at RM-500 would indi-

cate a fallure in the containment system. This

may

necessitate shutting down the helium sys-

tem which in turn destroys the reliability of

level indication in both the pump bowls and

the

overflow tank. Since the overflow tank

level is considered safety, loss of it requires

a reactor shutdown.

2.4,

2.4,

In case of high and/or increasing activ-

at RM-500, the operator should:

.1 Make a hasty check to determine if

the indication 1s real. Take a portable
radiation detector and measure the activ-
ity at the line, and have an instrument

mechanic check the instruments.

 

2 Any actual activity in the line would
probably be caused by high pressure in
the system involved or low supply pres-
sure. If possible adjust pressures,
purge out the lines and valve off the

system or component involved.

 

3 If source of activity cannct be
located and isolated, consider taking
the reactor subcritical and stopping

the fuel and coolant pumps.

Init. Date/Time

 

2.4k If it is necessary to stop the helium
flow to the FP bubblers, a reliable level
indication in the pump bowls and overflow
tank will be lost. This necessitates
draining both the fuel and coolant systems.

2.4.5 Continue efforts to determine which line
allowed the backflow of activity.

RM-596 (Helium Suovply To FP Bubblers) (1 out

of 2 monitors causes control action.)

Activity in the line at RM-596 indicates

 

a breakdown in containment. High radiation

level at RM-596 automatically closes the

block valves in the bubbler lines. This
destroys the reliability of the fuel salt
level indicators in both the pump bowl and
the overflow tank. The overflow tank level
is considered part of the safety system,

and loss of this necessitates a shutdown.
Upon receiving high radiation indication

on RM-596, the operator should proceed as
follows:

2.5.1 Quickly attempt to determine if the
activity ds real. Using a portable
radiation instrument measure the
activity of the lines next to the
process monitor, and have an instrument
mechanic check the instruments.

z.5.2 1f the activity is real, take the

 

reactor subcritical and stop the fuel
pump. Adjust pressures to prevent
further backup of activity.

salt in the pump bowl, proceed with a

normal drain of the fuel system.

 

2.5.6 Upon completion of the drain, freeze
the freeze valves.

RM-0T-1 and RM-07-2 (Lube 0il Tanks) (Alarms

 

 

only)

Activity in OT-1 may increase as the
approach to full power is made. This would
probably be due to fissiocn product diffusion
across the pump sealg into the oil stream.
This increase in radiation should be small
unless the pump seals start lesking exces-
sively. In case of high and/or increasing
radiation at either or both of the lube aQil
packages, the operstor should proceed as
follows:

2.6.1 Check with a portable radiation
instrument to verify the indications
received on the monitors.

2.6.2 Check the level of the oil catch
tank which is attached to the system

 

of interest. A seal leaking badly
enough to allow rapid radiation in-
creases in the oill tank may cause an
increase of oil level in the oil
cateh tank.

2.6.3 If the o0il catch-tank level is

 

increasing, refer to PBrocedure GH.

The bulk of the gas flowing through these
lines flows down the vump shafts and should
help prevent fission product gasses from
reaching the oll seals.

2.6.5 If it is verified that the radiation

 

indicated 1s real and reading above limits
at the tank, take the reactor subcritical
and stop the salt pump.

2.6.6 If RM-557 increases close valves in

 

the offgas lines from the oil system to

prevent automatic closing of RCV-557.

 

2.6.7 If there is an abnormal increase in
the OCT level, proceed as described in
OH. Consideration should be given to
reducing the shield oil flow rate to
minimize suction from the shield oil
ocutlet jet.

2.6.8 If there is no abnormal oil leakage
as indicated by OCT level, continue oil
flow to the pump bearings.

2.6.9 To prevent over heating of the fuel
pump, keep an oil flow to the shield
plug until the reactor is drained or
until the amount of activity in the
cil system endangers personnel.

noted on RIA-557A or RIA-557B, the operator
should proceed ags follows:

2.7.1 Check with a portable radiation instru-
ment to determine if the activity indica-
tion is real. Have an instrument mechanic

check the instruments.

 

. a.7.2 If the activity increases above limits,
check that the control circuits close
. HCV-557, PCV-513-Az, and PCV-510-A2. If
the control circuits fail, close these
manually.
2.7.3 Check RM-528A and B. If these are
reading high, consult Section 9E 2.3

 

of this procedure.
2.7.4 Check RM-Q0T-1 and RM-0T-2. If these
. are reading high, consult Section 9E

2.6 of this procedure.

 

c.7.5 Try to determine the source of the
activity. Use a portable radiation
‘ indicator and check the following
lines individually.
562 - from auxillary charcoal bed
557 - from main charcoal beds
560 - from oil system and coolant

system.

 

2.7.6 Close the hand valve in the line which
shows activity. Then try to reset RM-55T7A
. and B. If these will reset, operations
using the other lines may continue. How-

2.7.7 If the activity is from the main char-
coal beds and/or if HCV-557 will not re-
open, take the reactor suberitical and -
consider stopping the fuel pump. IT

pump. The bubblers may remain in opera-
tion until pressure starts building up
in the charcoal beds.

2.7.8 If repairs are needed or an excessive
amount of time is involved before the
situation can be corrected, it may be
desirable to drain the system.

3 HIGH STACK ACTIVITY

It is conceivable that highly radioactive contaminants could

 

be expelled to the stack, then on to the atmosphere. This is a
particularly hazardous situation because the entire surrounding
area could be involved.
Instrumentation is provided on the offgas stack for detecting
beta, gamma, and alpha activity. A charcoal trap is also provided .
to aid in the detection of iodine. These detectors are all of the
type which collect contaminants on filter paper or in the charcoal; .
therefore, they may continually show a slight increase in activity.
1t is fast and/or large increases in the detector readings which
should warn the operator of trouble.
The stack monitors are set to alarm upon receiving an increase
of 20% on the beta-gamma detector, 30% on the alpha detector, and
80% on the iodine detector. These are percentages of full scale
with full scale normally being 250 count/min. The scale may be

changed to meet the operating conditions; however, when the scale
il e

Approved by ,4575531¢4¥

Ll OE-11
" v 9/21/65

needs to be changed, notify the stack monitoring group btefore making
the switch except in emergency cases. Under unusual conditions the
Laboratory Facilities Department may request MSRE personnel to
change ranges. If the shift supervisor agrees, these requests
should be complied with.

The percentages of increase listed previously must be within
a 15 minute period before the Laboratory Facilities Department will
notify the operator of abnormal release. 1If this increase persists
for another 30 minutes, the laboratory shift supervisor will be
notified, and he may reduest a reactor shutdown. His requests
must be followed to insure the safety cf the entire ORNL Area.

The tapes of these detectors are advanced every 8 hours.

The percentage of increase listed previously (20% for Beta-gamma,
30% for alpha, 80% for iodine) within this time period will cause
the respective module to go into alaxm condition. Even though a
slow increase over an 8-hour period would not be considered hazard-
ous, each stack activity alarm must be investigated promptly.

It seems logical to expect that stack increases will be either
very rapid or very slow. The following steps are to aid the oper-
ator for these cases. Any intermediate increases should be
handled in such a way as to insure personnel saflety. The shift
supervisor should assess the situation and made decisions concern-
ing operations with tThis in mind.

Init. Date/Time

 

3.1 High Stack Activity Check List

Upon receiving a stack activity alarm
or notification of high stack activity, the
operator should check the chart of the instru-
ment giving the high activity indication.
Verify the reading by contacting the stack
monitoring group. Phone No. 3-623L4. If the
activity is increasing rapidly (greater than
alarm set point in 15 minutes) with no signs
of leveling off, assume that hazardous quan-

tities of activity are being released, and
Approved p¥4§2é; /ﬁéévﬁiygzqﬂm\ OE-1Z2

proceed as follows:

3.1.1 Take the reactor subecritical.

 

3.1.2 Report the incident to the Emergency
Control Center (Phone No. 3-6358).
3.1.3 Ask the Hmergency Control Center to

send Health Physics Surveyors if sur-

 

veyors are not already on hand.

 

3.1.4 Announce the emergency over the P. A.
and request all personnel (except those
involved in combating the emergency) to
assemble at the northwest corner of the
7503 bullding basement (84O-ft level),
if this action appears necessary.

3.1.5 Dispatch two Emergency Squad Members
equipped with assault masks and portable
radiation meters to check outside the
building and assess the nature and extent
of the hazard. Further action depends
upon the assessment of the hazard.

3.1.6 1In case the activity is increasing
slowly (greater than the set point in
Ik hours), the operator should proceed
as folliows:
3.1.6.1 Ask the stack monitoring group

to advance the tape. This should
reduce the chart to background.
3.1.6.2 Keep a careful watch on the

instrument for further increases.

9F CONTROL ROD DRIVE DIFFICULTY

Due to the dependence placed on control rod reliability, any anoma-

lous control rod behavior must be considered very serious in nature. If

any irregularity in ccntrol rod behavior is noted, the reactor should be

taken subcritical by inserting all rods and the cause of the malfunction

should be corrected if possible. If repairs can not be made a reactor

drain may be necessary.

ouggested corrective actions to be taken under varlous circumstances

are gilven below:

1 INABILITY TO WITHDRAW ROD(s)

1.1

1.2

1.3

1.k

If a control rod will not withdraw, check
the jumper board. If control action is
inhibiting the withdrawal, change the opera-

ting conditions to satisfy the interlocks.

 

If control action is not preventing the rods
from withdrawing, insert all rods to their

lower limit. If necessary, scram the rods.

 

If any rod fails to insert to lower limit,

consider draining the fuel system.

 

If all rods drop to lower limit, determine
the cause of the difficulty and take neces-

sary action to correct it.

 

2 INABILITY TO INSERT ROD(s)

2.1

2.2

If a control rod does not insert upon re-
quest, when not already on lower limit,
scram the rods. Failure of a control rod to

insert is a potentially dangerous situation.

 

After scramming the rods check that all rods
dropped to the lower limit. If all did not,

consider draining the fuel system.

9G LOSS OF COMPUTER

One normally-operating component which is operated in conjunction
with the reactor is the "on-line" computer, a Bunker-Ramo 340. When in
operation, the computer will log system data, scan selected variables
to see that they remain within limite, and perform routine calculations
such as heat balances. It is estimated that the computer will be "on
line"” about 99% of the time. During the time when the computer is not
in operation, part of its duties must be performed manually. There are
two hours of maintenance scheduled for the computer every two weeks.
This is not considered abnormal, and with the exception of belng espe-
cially alert for abnormalities, the operator will not normally have any

added duties at this time.

Init. Date/Time

 

1 CHECK LIST WHEN COMPUTER IS ABNORMALLY SHUT DOWN

 

It is especially important to make log entries
as thorough and exact as possible since some infor-
mation normally on the logger will not be avallable.
1.1 Start taking the abnormal control-room log

(12A-2B).

 

1.2 Start using the addendum %o the check lists
12B 1.1 (shift supervisor's check list) as
well as the regular check lists. This
addendum includes such things as calculating

heat balances and reactivity balances.

 

1.3 If the anticipated shutdown of the computer
is to be longer than 2 days, transfer the
following thermocouples to the special
recorders so they may be watched closely.
Finish filling out the following table.
For short periods when the computer is
shut down, these will be recorded periodically
on the building log. These will be read out
by momentarily plugging each into T 1.3200

or a portable veadout instrument.

k.l DNormal oil seal leakage is O to 4O cc/day;

 

however, a larger seal leakage can be toler=
ated. If the oil leakage across the seal
exceeds 100 cc/day, notify the operations
chief and prepare for a normal reactor shut-
down per Procedure 10A.

4.2 Should a gross leak develop (31000 cc/hr),
drain reactor per Procedure 10B (special
shutdown).

’ NOTE: Assuming that the syphon pot is full and the lower
section of the OCT is 1/2 full, a leak rate of 1000 ce/hr
allows ~ 2 shifts for fuel drain refill with flush salt
and drain before OCT's is full.

 

In addition, the operator should do the following:
4.2.1 Reduce pressure differential between
oil supply tank and salt system to zero
psi.
4.2.2 Reduce bearing oil flow (FI-703, 753)

9T SALT IN OVERFLOW TANK

Fuel salt can enter the OFT by overfilling the pump bowl, by splash-
ing during pump operation and by a volume expansion due L0 a temperature
excursion. Whenever the 10% level alarm point of the OFT or the FP low
level alarm point is reached, the salt must be emptied from the OFT.

If the reactor is at power, it must first be reduced to zero by the
procedure in Section 10A of the Operating Procedures. The OFT off-gas
line will then be closed and the bubbler gas will build up pressure and
force the salt to the pump bowl. If the FP stops when the gas pressure
in the OFT is releaged . through the overflow line into the pump bowl,
the pump should be restarted.

Init. Date/Time

 

1 DETAILED PROCEDURE FOR EMPTYING THE OFT
1.1 Reduce the reactor power level to zero by .
Procedure 10A. Do not stop the FP. Fully

ingsert all three control rods. After-heat

 

generation will continue to heat the fuel
salt; therefore, the reactor outlet temper-
ature must be observed and the coolant system
operated in such a manner as to prevent
overheating. Raising the outlet radiator
door should be sufficient to remove this
heat. If not, raise the inlet door as
required after the outlet door is full open.
Observe the reactor and radiator outlet
temperatures repeatedly and make the neces-
sary changes in operating conditions to
prevent overheating or overcooling either

system.

9J LOSS OF He PURGE TO THE CIRCULATING PUMPS

Loss of He purge to the circulating pumps could result from low

supply pressure which closes the supply valves, radiocactivity in the FP

bubbler lines which closes the block valves, or failure of the valves or

valve operators.

1

L0SS OF FIOW THROUGH LINE 516

 

The most critical situation occurs when fleow through line 516,
the FP purge line, stops during power operation. Radioactive gas
could migrate up the annulus around the shaft to the bearing lube
oil and salt mist could migrate up the annuius and freeze. This
could clog the annulus and seize the pump rotary element. The pump
should not be operated longer than 1/2 hour or after the radioac-
tivity level in the lube oil exceeds 20 mr/hr., the low level alarm
point. If the reactor is at power, 1t should be taken to the zero
power level by the normal shutdown procedure section 10A, before
stopping the pump. The system temperatures must be observed
carefully after stopping the pump and the system drained if it appears
they will exceed 130C°F. Drain the fuel system only and do not
flush at this time.

[0SS OF FIOW TO THE OVERFIOW TANK BUBBLERS

A loss of flow to the overflow tank bubblers will be annunciated
in the control room. Unless flow can be reestablished the fuel
system should be drained.
1OSS OF FIOW TO THE FP BUBBLERS

If flow is lost to one of the FP bubblers, the cother bubbler can
be selected and normal operation can continue. However, if both
bubblers are inoperative the system must be shut down and drained.
Drain fuel system only and do not flush,

LO5S OF FIOW THROUGH LINE 512

If flow stops in line 512 and can not be reestablished, the

coolant pump should be stopped within 1/2 hour. The power should be
Approved b@«l ) %; %2

reduced to zero. If the system temperatures exceed 1300°F, drain the
fuel system but do not flush.
5 I0SS OF FIOW TO THE COOIANT PUMP BUBBLERS
If flow is lost to both bubblers, operation can continue by
selecting the float level element. If no level indicator is
operable on the ccoolant pump, the power should be reduced until a

level element is in operation.

9K 1085 OF COMPONENT COOLING BLOWERS

1 10SS OF EITHER CCP-1 or CCP-2
The loss of the operating CCP will be indicated by low AP on PAT 960

 

and/or low CCP oil pressure. These are annunciated on MB-2.

On loss of one CCP, the alternate blower should be started. The
stop button of the malfunctioning blower may have to be pushed before
starting the stand-by unit.

A delay in starting the stand-by unit will contribute to the Tollow-
ing actions:

1. Thermocycle of fuel pump bowl.

2. Damage to control rod drive motors.

3. Thawing FV-103 and draining the fuel system.

T Loss of cooling to reactor neck and control rods.

After starting the stand-by blower, the Chief of Operations should be
notified. Continued operation without an alternate blower will be an
administrative decision.

2 1IO0SS OF CCP-1 and CCP-2

Loss of both blowers will initiate a drain when FV-103 thaws,

Since loss of cooling air can damage the control rod motors and
pump bowl an effort should be made to get at least one of the blowers
back in service as soon as possible.

3 10SS OF CCP #3
Loss of this blower will cause thawing of FV-204 and FV-206 which

 

will drain the cooclant system and terminate operatlons. Service air from
AC-3 ( or Instrument Air Compressors) should be valved into line 906 at
V-06TA. PCV-967 should be set at 8 pesig to maintain normal air flow to

the freeze valves.

domes it could cause the fuel salt to freeze. The presence of the water
will be indicated by the steam dome level indicators on the main instru-
ment panels, by the FWT level indicators in the water room and a decrease
in temperature in the drain tanks. The operator should remove the water
from the steam domes and refill the feed water tanks in the following
manner; a radiation survey meter should be used to monitor the operation.

ON HIGH CELL LEAK RATE INDICATION

A high RC leak rate indication could result from a high leak rate,

an increase in cell ambient temperature or water leaking into the cell

and vaporizing. A rise in the RC pressure will be indicated by an

alarm and pressure indication in the main control room.

tive
tive
1

The cell evacuation rate should be increased to maintain a nega-
pressure and the cause of the difficulty investigated and correc-
action taken as given below:

SALT LEAKING INTO THE CELL

 

This would be indicated by high cell air activity or a loss
of fuel salt level (FV-103 still frozen) or a loss of coolant salt
level (FV-20L4 and 206 still frozen). The operator should drain
the fuel and/or coolant systems immediately. ©See Section 10B
of the MSRE Operating Procedures.

WATER LEAKING INTO THE CELL

 

This would be indicated by the reactor or drain tank sump
bubbler and/or sump level probes. There would also be a decrease
in level in the condensate tank in use or in the treated water
surge tank. The operator should valve off the leasking line and
proceed accordingly.

2.1 If a cell space cooler water line is leaking, proceed as de-
scribed in 9N-3.

2.2 1If the water line to the fuel pump motor is leaking, the
motor may overheat. Monitor the thermoccouple on the motor
TE-FPM-1 and drain the fuel system to prevent the tempersture
from exceeding l5OOF. If 1t is necessary to shut off the
motor, it can probably be restarted after draining the pump
to aid in afterheat removal. The power required to circulate
helium is a small fraction of that required to circulate salt;
therefore, the motor should not require as much cooling.

2.3 If the leak is in the water lines to the thermal shield, the

reactor should be drained and the fuel system cooled .

3 LOSS OF REACTOR OR DRAIN TANK SPACE COOQLERS
This would be indicated by a loss of cooling water flow, lights

at the motor starter for the space coolers or high cell temperatures.
The operator should monitor the cell temperatures while trying to
correct the trouble. If the average cell temperature reaches ZOOOF,
the reactor should be drained and as many heaters shut off as pos-
sible. If it 1s necessary to keep the RC pressure below atmospheric
while correcting the trouble, evacuate through line 565 by opening
V-565-C in the VH. When the cell cooler is restarted, observe the
cell pressure carefully. To avoid depressurizing the cell below
-3 psig,connect a N5 cylinder to line 332 in the water room and
add Ny to the cell through it, or if necessary, add compressed air
through line 332.

L ACTUAL HIGH CELL LEAK RATE

This would be indicated by the cell pressure increasing and

 

the inability to find any reason for this such ag given above.
The operator should take the reactor subcritical by the procedure
of Section 10A and start evacuating through line 565 to maintain
a -2 psig in the RC. He should attempt to locate the source of
Tthe leak and repair it if possible without draining the system.
Otherwise, he should continue with the shutdown as given in

Section 10A.

SECTION 10
REACTOR SHUTDOWN

Periodical normal shutdowns are planned for the reactor to sample
the graphite, make equipment modifications and change fuel salt composition.
The shutdowns may be necessary due to equipment failures or abnormal
conditions. Shutdown, as described in this section, consists of storing
the molten fuel salt in the drain tanks and freezing the freeze valves

to isolate it from the fuel system.

10A NORMAL SHUTDOWN

Normal shutdown as described in this section consists of lowering

the reactor power from 10 Mw, draining the salt to the drain tanks,

flushing the fuel system with flush salt, and cooling the fuel and cool-

ant systems to ambient temperature. Salt in the drain tanks will nor-

mally be kept molten. Freeze valves will be frozen to isolate each tank

from the rest of the system. If it is necessary to quickly drain the

reactor without removing the afterheat, follow procedure given in 10B.

1

POWER REDUCTION AND GOING SUBCRITICAL

 

The power removal rate will be lowered by lowering the air flow
through the radiator. The nuclear power will be reduced to main-
tain a constant reactor outlet temperature. The manipulations nec-
essary depend on the mode of operation. Two possible modes are de-
scribed below.

1.1 ILoad Control Automatic and Control Rods on Servo Control

 

Under these conditions the power removal rate is reduced by
switching the load control switch to decrease. The servo con-
troller will manipulate the rods to maintain a constant outlet
temperature. The radiator doors will not go below the inter-
mediate limit (corresponding to approximately 1 Mw). Manual
load control and rod manipulaticn will be necessary below this

level. BSteps involved are listed below:

Initg. Date/Time

 

1.1.1 Switch load demand (S24) to decrease
load and hold. Note that the AP set point
will lower causing the bypass dampers to
open until fully opened. The AP set point
will stop changing and the automatic blower
will stop. This will cause the AP to de-
crease below the set point. The dampers
will start closing and the AP set point
start decreasing. When AP and AP set
point are equal, the AP set point will

continue to decrease which will cause
the dampers to reopen. When they are
fully open again, the inlet and outlet
doors will start lowering. When they
reach the intermediate position, they
will stop. During this time, check
that the servo control manipulates
the rods to maintain a constant reactor
outlet temperature. Manually adjust

the shim rods as necessary.

1.1.2 Switch the load control mode selector
switch (823) to manual.

 

1.1.3 Push the "run off" button (8-12) which
will put the reactor in the "start" mode.
This will switch the rod servo to flux
servo and will control the flux at 1 Mw
or at the flux demand if both pico
ammeter range switches are in the 1.5

Mw range.

 

1.1.4 Check that both pico ammeter range
switches are in 1.5 Mw range and adjust
flux demand to hold the outlet tempera-

ture constant.

 

1.1.5 Manually turn off the operating radi-

ator blower.

 

1.1.6 Fully insert all three control rods
and manually adjust the outlet and/or
inlet doors to maintain the fuel and
coolant systems at approximately 12259F.

COOLDOWN OF FUEL AND COOLANT SYSTEMS

 

 

Lower the heater settings or turn off the heaters
to cool down the fuel and coolant systems. The
circulating pumps will be used to circulate helium
during cooldown to help egualize temperature and
cool down the graphite. Cooldown rate should be
limited to approximately 300°F per hour to allow
time for the graphite to cool. Helium purge

rate will be kept maintained to avoilid a vacuum

on the systems. The drain tanks will not normally
be cooled. If malntenance is necessary on them,
precautions will be necessary in safely storing
the salt. Specilal instructions will be issued
when needed.

10B SPECIAL SHUTDOWNS

There are a number of known conditions which wlll cause some degree
of automatic shutdown (see Part IT on process instrumentation) or which
will make it desirable to take some action toward shutting down the re-
actor (see Section 9 of this part). If it is necessary to quickly drain
the reactor without removing the afterheat, the procedure is somewhat
different than a normal shutdown. Details of the procedure are given

below:

1 POWER REDUCTION AND GOING SUBCRITICAL
If an automatic or manual emergency drain has been initiated,
FV-103, 105, and 106 will start to thaw and the vent valves on the
drain and flush tanks will open. When fuel salt starts to drain,
the fuel pump will stop which will seram the control rods if the
power 1s greater than 15 kw. The coolant radiator ocutlet tempera-
tures will decrease causing a load scram and coolant drain. After
a drain request has been initiated there will be 10 or 15 minutes
before FV-103 thaws. The operator should do the following:

Tnit. Date/Tinme

 

1.1 Determine the cause of the drain request and
remedy the situation if possible. If not
possible, record all informatlion which might

aid in future evaluation of the difficulty.

 

1.2 Isolate a fuel sample.

 

Record FD-1 and FD-2 weigh cell readings.

 

1.4 Scram the control rods and note that they are

fully inserted.

 

1.5 Lower power removal by stopping both blowers

(MB-1 and 3) and closing both radiator doors.

DRATNING AND FIUSHING The : FUEL SYSTEM
If time permits, Section 10A-2 should be

 

followed including flushing with flush salt. In

addition the following should e done.

2.1 Check temperatures of FV-103 to determine
that the valve is thawing. If it appears that
component cooling air is still on to the
valve, shut off both component coolant pumps
untlil the valve thaws. Then restart a
component coolant pump to restore cooling to

the other freeze valves and control rods.

 

Stopping the component coolant pumps should be
avolded if possible because it thermal cycles the
pump bowl. Close HCV-903 (set HIC-903 at maximum)
before starting component coolant pumps.

2.2 The drain tank cooling system will automati-
cally go into operation if the drain tank
temperature exceeds 1300°F. However, the
Tollowing should be done to assure proper
operation. Check that adequate condensate is
available in the feed water tanks and cooling

water to the drain tank condensers.

 

2.3 Check that the drain tank temperatures are
controlled between 1350°F and 900°F.

 

2.4 Take a complete inventory (check list
12B-5) if possible. At least record FD-1

and FD-2 manometers when drain 1s complete,

 

2.5 If it 1s not possible to flush the system
with flush salt, switch to prefill and start
the fuel pump to circulate helium, which will
aid in the removal of afterheat. The fuel
system temperatures should be continuously

scanned for hot spots from fission products.

11. GSHUTDOWN OPERATIONS

During periods when the reactor is shut down, a variety of operations
may be necessary. Due to the fact that these are not done routinely and
that the manner of accomplishing them may change from shutdown teo shutdown,
it is extremely important that the operating crew be alert to all possible
hazardous or otherwise undesirable conditions. As during operation, the
shift supervisor is in charge of and is responsible for all work done in
the area. As the daily cost of shutdown is quite high, all unnecessary
delays should be avoided. However, it should be emphasized that a wrong
decision made hastily may be costly in time or money.

During shutdown an abbreviated log will be taken. This should be used
as a guide only, and the person taking the log should be alert to undesir-
able conditions which might exist.

Detailed procedures are given below for some of the foreseeable shutdown
operaticns. Remote maintenance procedures are given in Part IX of the

11A TUEL OR FIUSH SALT TRANSFERS

No salt transfers will be made while the reactor is in operation or
when there is salt in the fuel system. Most transfers will be made with
the reactor and drain tank cells at 12.7 psia; howsver, transfers can be
made with the seal pans removed but with all lower cell blocks in place.
Controlled ventilation would then serve as the secondary containment. No
fuel should be transferred to F3T until 4 days after a drain to allow for
Xenon decay.

The transfer operations consist of:

(a) Heating the transfer lines and tanks,

(b) Taking inventory,

(¢c) Thawing or freezing the necessary freeze valves,

(d) Pressurizing the supply tank and venting the receiver tank un-

til the transfer is complete,

(e) Blowing the salt out of the transfer lines,

(f) Freezing the freeze valves,

(g) Taking another inventory.

Details of the transfer operations are given below. Descriptions are
given for transferrirg to and from FD-1, FD-2, FFT, and FST. Instructions
for fuel or flush salt removal to the waste storage tank or removél of
coolant salt will be issued at the time this is to be done.

The following procedures are based on the assumption that the trans-
fer lines contain no salt other than that at or near the freeze valves. If
salt is known to be in the lines, special instructions will be issued.

or necessary to cool the surge pots and piping
associated with the freeze valve. BSince it is not
possible to remove all of the salt (except for
FV-103), special precautions must be taken to
prevent rupturing the pipe due to expansion of the
salt as it is heated. The outside areas are heated
first to melt the salt so that there is room for
expansion. In all cases it is assumed that the
adjacent pipe does not contain salt or that the
salt is molten. Interlocks on TE's prevent thaw-
ing of the FV's if the pot temperatures are less
than 950°F. Other interlocks prevent thawing
FV's under certain conditions.
1h,1 Heatup of Freeze Valve Assemblies FV-107,

To prevent possible rupture of the assemblies,
the freeze valve Syphon break on adjacent
lines should be heated to above 900°F before
thawing the valve. The valve heater control-
lers will then have to be adjusted for normal
operation (See Section LI).

11B OPENING REACTOR CELL, DRAIN TANK
CELL AND COQLANT CEHLL

After a power operation considerable radioactivity may be present
in the reactor cell, drain tank cell and coolant cell. Therefore, great
care must be exercised when opening the shields. Tae fuel should be
drained into one of the drain tanks. Since a rupture in the drain tank
afterheat-removal thimbles could cause a release of considerable steam
and radloactivity, it is desirable to allow sufficient time after shut-
down so thav ccoling 1s no longer required. The cooling thimbles should
be boiled dry and the water stored in the FWD's. The coolant salt should
also be drained. All heatere except those required to keep the salts
molten in the tanks should be off if the shutdown is to be a lengthy one.

Since secondary containment i1s provided by inflow of air when the
shields are opened, the stack must run continuously. In order to main-
tain the regquired 100 ft/min flow into the cells, the maximum open area
ls restricted to approximately 130 sq ft.

Bach shutdown will involve different operations, and it is difficult
to write specific instructions in advance. Therefore, it is especially
important for the cperator to be alert for hazards or other items which
have been overlooked. It is desirable to shut off all electrical power
not required in order to reduce shock hazard during maintenance opera-
tions. Other equipment and systems such as water and oil systems should
be shut down if not needed. "Do not operate” tags should be attached to
all valves and breakers involved. These tags should state that the
reason for tagging is a reactor shutdown. Shift supervisor's permission
should be given as the condition required to remove them. In case a
specific piece of equipment is to be worked on, an additional tag should
be attached giving the work request number.

The white slips should be attached to a copy of this section of the
Operating Procedures and should be removed at the end of the shutdown
when the shield is closed.

Care should be taken to valve out the leak detector to any flange
before it is opened. When 1t is closed, a leak check should be started

immediately.

PROCESS SYSTEMS

The process systems will be tested by gas pressurizing to €5 psig

at temperature orf 1200°F as outlined in Operating Procedure, Section
Sit,

AUXILIARY SYSTEMS

All systems and components will be hydrostatically tested where
safety or equipment integrity requires such a test. The requirements
of Section VIII of the ASBME Unfired Pressure Vessel Code will be
adhered to. ©See Table 1. Commercial gas equipment will be tested

or returned to the supplier for testing by procedures governed by

plant policy and 1.C.C. No. 73.34 J.

PRESSURE RELIEF VALVES

Table 2 lists all pressure relief valves that are protective devices,
the normal setting, test limits and frequency of testing. Valves
affecting personnel safety will be tested annually and valves

protecting only equipment will be tested biannually.

RUPTURE DISCO

The rupture discs in the MSRE are tabulated in Table 3. Unless

frequent pressure fluctuations are observed which might affect the
accuracy of the discs, all rupture discs will be changed after every
two years of operation.

With equipment now installed, it is impossible to hudrostatically

test the cells again. However, the cell leak rate (at a -2 psig

pressure differential) is monitored continuously during operation,
and the cells will be tested at 20 psig after each time they are
opened. The vapor condensing system will be pneumatically tested
along with the reactor and drain tank cells.
6. SECONDARY CONTAINMENT VESSELS
All small secondary containment vessels which are isolated from the
main cells will be tested about every two years with sa pneumatié test to 1.25

times the design pressure, see containment vessels, Table b,

SECTION 12
ROUTINE OBSERVATIONS

 

The most important functions of the operating crew are Lo carry
out the prescribed program in a logical manner and record adeguate
data.

The acquisition of data can be accomplished in a number of differ-
ent ways; however, with an operation such as the MSRE, which is manned
on all three shifts, it is necessary to standardize this as much as

possible. The following describes the method to be usged at the MSRE.

12A LOGS

CONTROL ROOM LOG BOOK

 

The control room log book is a journal in which the time and
nature of all operations are recorded. This log provides a record
of operations for evaluation of the performance of the reactor, for
keeping operating personnel mutually informed, and particularly for
providing each oncoming shift (and day supervision) with a record of
what the previous shifts have done.

The log 1s ncrmally kept by a control room technician; however,
each member of the operating crew must be sure that a record of all
significant operations which he performs or observes is adequately
entered in the log. Each entry should begin with the time the
operation tcok place, and should be initialed.

The log must be a complete record of all significant operations,
but be as free as possible of unnecessary details. It is better to
put too much in the log than to leave out details which may later
prove to be significant. Operations personnel are responsible for
adequately recording all activities that occur on each shift. This
includes activities of non-operating personnel.

At the start of each shift, enter in the log the personnel
assigrments for the shift, and the reactor conditions at shift
change. Enter the date and shift at the top of each page. This
makes it convenient to find who worked a given shift and what work
was in progress. Conclude the shift entries with a "status,” which
should include a summary of the reactor operating conditions for
the previous 8 hours, a list of all important changes in operations,
and sufficient information about operations in progress to enable .
the next shift to take over smoothly.

New log books are kept in the operations file cabinet. DHince
the page numbering continues from log to log, care should be taken
that the proper new log book is selected. Completed logs are also
filed in the operations office. A carbon copy is made for use by

non-operating personnel and is filed in the operations office.

Approved byzéﬁﬁﬁfq

 

Xerox copies are provided for the coordinstor and the department .
head.
The shift supervisor is responsible for reviewing the log at
the end of his shift to be certain that all significant occurrences
are adequately recorded.

1.1 Items which should be included in the log are:

 

Equipment started or stopped.

Valves opened or closed.

Switches or breakers opened or closed.

Procedures or parts of procedures started, worked on, or
completed. ‘
Changes in settings of controls or valves.

Major changes in settings of heater controllers.
Annunciations, and action taken.

Abnormal conditions or malfunctioning equipment found.
Purpose of a given series of operations, unless obvious Or
routine.

Observations, interpretations, and conclusions drawn from
operating results.

Samples taken.

Significant maintenance and other non-operational jobs done.

1.2 Items which need not be recorded in this log are: .

 

Those which are recorded elsewhere except for especially
important items which may be repeated for emphasis.

Details of operations covered by a written procedure or
check list. Any exception to the procedure should be noted
as well as time referencesand results if of significance.

2 CONTROL ROOM AND BUILDING LOGS

A1l pertinent temperatures, flows, pressures, etc., not recorded

 

elsewhere are recorded on the control room and building logs. When
the computer is not in operation;. it is necessary to manually record
some items. normally recorded by the computer. These extra items

are on the control room log. Therefore, 2 control room log forms

are provided. Since the building log does not change, only one
Approved by Eﬁgf;ﬁAaéigy%m¢k1 ~ 124-3
Y 10/13/65

. building log form is required.

12A-2A Control Room Log (Computer in Operation), 12A-2B

Control Room Log (Computer not in Operation), 12A-3 Building

Log.

Where possible the normal reading for each item is given at
the head of each data column. The person initiating a new log
should correct iV to agree with the master log, located in "Master
Forms" file drawer.

. Each person taking a log must report any abnormal conditions
to the shift supervisor promptly. In addition, he must be alert
for signs of trouble or malfunctioning equipment as he makes the
rounds of the area.

Completed log sheets are placed in data holder in the control
room and are subsequently filed in the operations office by day
personnel.

3 LEAK-DETECTOR 1LOG

Since the operation of the leak-detector system is somewhat

 

independent of the rest of the reactor, operations done on this
system are recorded in a seperate log.
It 1s particularly important to note the status of any leak-
hunting cperations and all valves that are closed at the end of
. each shift.
L THERMOCOUPLE TABULATION LOG (12A-k4)

There are some 900 thermocouples and 700 temperature readout

 

locations at the MSRE. Since the readout of any thermocouple (except
for 120 on the coolant radiator) can be easily changed at the patch
panel, a thermocouple tabulation log will be maintained. In the
"Thermocouple to Instrument” log, the thermocouples are lisbed
numerically along with a brief description of their locations in

the system. Columns are provided to enter the "readout"” location

of each thermocouple. When the "readout” of any thermocouple is
changed, this fact should be entered along with the date, time, and

. initial of the person making the entry.
Approved by25;?5§$/572%77van< 12A-4

10/13/65

The "Instrument to Thermocouple" log lists the "readout” instru- .
ments and "readout” points in numerical order along with the location
of the instrument in the building. Columns are provided for indi-
cating which thermocouple is attached to each point. When a change
is made on the input to any instrument, this fact should be entered
along with the date, time, and initial of the person making the

entry. Thus it is possible to determine where any thermocouple was

 

recorded at any time or what thermocouple was recorded on any instru-~ .
ment.

5 HEATER CONTROLLER SETTINGS LOG (12A-5) |

The heater controller settings will be recorded periodically .

on the building log; however, a chronological history of the settings
will be helpful to operations. A log is available at the heater
control area with columns for entering date, time and controller
setting. As these are strictly an operational guide, they may be
discarded after use.
6 FLANGE LOG
A history of all reactor system flanges monitored by the leak

 

detector system will be kept jointly by operations and maintenance.
Pertinent information on closing of these flanges such as torque
and leak rates will be kept in this log.
In the back of this log will be kept a list of any fittings
which have been opened which require helium leak testing. This
list will be in the form of a punch list requesting the leak checks .
of a particular fitting. These punch lists are accumulated and all
leak tested by maintenance during shutdown. .
Ji SAMPLE LOGS
A record of all samples taken from all systems will be kept

 

in the sample logs in the operations office. Entries will be made
in these logs both when the sample is taken and when the analysis
result is obtained. A sample number will be assigned according to
the last previous record in the sample log. The sample log will
also contain information on the allowable limits for analysis of

desired (or undesirable) contents.

12C RECORDERS AND INDICATORS

Numerous recording and indicating instruments are used throughout
the plant. In general, indicators are used where needed as guides TO
operation and where only periodic records are necessary. Recorders
are used where & continuous record of the variable is required or when
a trend would be helpful to operating personnel. In order that the
recorder charts are cf maximum value, proper functioning of the instru-
ment must be assured. This necessitates periodic inspection to assure
that the instrument is running, chart paper is installed properly and
is tracking, and that the pen is marking (or points printing). It is,
of course, highly important that the instrument never runs out of chart
paper without immediate replacement.

Since no timing devices are installed, the time should be carefully
marked on all operating charts at least twice per shift. This should
be at the start and near the middlie of the shift. When operating
conditions are changed or disturbances occur, the time and probable
reason for the disturbance or change should be noted.

The 12-8 shift will routinely remove charts from all operating
recorders each day at approximately OTOO_(exception ~ cams). If a
special experiment is in progress, it may be desirable to remove them
at different intervals. All charts removed on a given date are filed
together in a pigeonhole file in Building 7503. Charts are held in
this file for three weeks after removal from the recorders. Then they
are placed in boxes and sent to Laboratory Records for storage in
Building 4500. Each chart file box is given an identification number
and can be checked out through Laboratory Records at any time for study
of the contents. A file index is kept so that the location of the chart
from any instrument covering any period of time can be determined. When
special experiments are being run, the person in charge of the experi-
ment may have sections of chart removed at any time if this will facil-
itate analysis of the experiment. However, these sections of chart

should be filed in the same manner as other charts.
</
Approved by ,ffé;éiagiiééfzmﬂhx 12C-2
> \/

10/13/65

One person will be placed in charge of the chart filing systen.
It is his duty to do the following:

1. Fach day check all newly removed charts to see that they are
properly marked with recorder number, time and date of instal-
lation and removal.

2. Twenty-one days after removal from recorder, place charts in
a chart file box.

3. When a file box is full, transmit to Laboratory Records for
storage. Record the dates covered by the charts. Laboratory
Records will record the identification number of the file box
in the Chart File Index.

Referring to Charts.

 

Recent charts can be found in the pigeonhole file under the
date of removal. When a chart is removed, a slip telling who
borrowed what must be placed in the pigeon hole. Charts should
be replaced as socn as possible.

Charts not filed in the pigeonholes should be obtained from
the Analysis Group.

Details of Recorder and Indicator Operations are as follows:
1. Avoid parallax when reading.
2. Record pen reading rather than pointer on recorders.

(Exception - beryllium monitor in vent house.)

3. Mark charts where pen is inking.
4. Push reset buttons once per shift.

When a chart is removed, mark it with the recorder number,

time, and date of removal. If the chart covers some particular

experiment or test, record this information also.

6. When installing a new chart, mark it with the recorder number,
time, and date of installation.

Mo If a chart is cut in two, mark both edges with the time, date,

and recorder number.

12D COMPUTER

The normal, permanent output of the computer is in the form of

Typewritten sheets from each of the four typewriters and full, or

partly full, reels of magnetic tape. During special experiments, graphs

mey be produced on the X-Y plotter as part of the output. In general,

all of this material will be permanently stored at the reactor site

with special arrangements as required.

1 TYPER OUTPUT

The preprinted log sheets used in Typer 2 must be replaced

once each shift using the detailed procedure in the Reactor
Operators’ Computer Manual. The completed sheets from the other
Typers may be removed at the convenience of the operators, depending
on the volume of paper generated. It is the responsibility of the
operators to insure that each sheet contains a calendar date to
identify the data. All typer sheets will be placed in the box
for completed data forms. Day personnel will file and subsequently
bind the sheets in chronological order by typer number and run
number for permanent storage.

2 MAGNETTIC TAPES

Megnetic tapes will be removed from the drives, as required,

according to the procedure in the computer manual. The identifi-
cation and removal of magnetic tapes should be recorded in the
control room log bock as a backup for other records. The operators
are responsible for adequate identification of all magnetic tapes
which they remove. 1In general, all magnetic tapes will be stored
in the tape cabinet in the computer room; full tapes will be filed
chronologically in the top of the cabinet,and blank tapes will be
stored in the bottom. Groups of partially filled tapes will be
consolidated periodically on single tapes and the partial tapes
returned to blank-type storage. Special arrangements will be made

if the storage capacity of the tape cabinet is exceeded.

Graphs of reactor parameters may be made at will by reactor
operators or other personnel. Any graphs that are pertinent to
the reactor operation or experimental program will be stored at
the reactor site with other run data. The original graphs may
be stored as such or they may become the property of individual
experiments. If original graphs are to be permanently removed,

properly identified copies must be made for the reactor files.

12E TAGS AND SIGNS

It is the policy of all personnel at the MSRE to honor all tags
and signs and assume that they are vallid until definitely proven other-
wise. When it is determined that tags or signs no longer apply, they
should be removed. Removing them often requires the permission of the
person who installed them.

1 TAGS
There are only 3 types of official tags in use at the MSRE.

Others should be used only in emergency and should be replaced by

an officlal tag as soon as possible. Tags should be installed by

operations personnel only.

1.1 Operational Tags

 

During operation there are certain valves, electrical
breakers, etc. which are normally open or closed. When these
are extremely important or could cause operational difficulties
or hazards if improperly operated, an operational tag is
attached. (See Figure 12E-1 and 12E-2.) In keeping with the
color scheme used at the MSRE, tags on closed valves or switches
vhich are off (Figure 12E-1) are green, and those on open
valves or switches which are on (Figure 12E-2) are red. As
indicated the shift supervisor's permission is required to
remove the tag or operate the valve or switch. An entry is
made in the console log when an operational tag is removed,
and the tag is discarded.

1.2 "Do Not Operate" Tags

During maintenance it is often necessary to tag out valves

 

or switches for the safety of the reactor or personnel. A
"do not operate" tag is used for this purpose. (See Figure
12E-3.) These tags are also used for special procedures etc.
where additional information needs to be included on the tag
or on the procedure. The tag is red cardboard. The bottom
half has a white paper on top with carbon paper between 1t

and the red cardboard. ter the blanks have been filied in,

the white sheets and carbon paper are removed. The white
sheets are filed with the work request or the procedure. When
the work or the procedure has been completed, all tags are
removed. These are cross checked with the white slips to
assure that none were missed and are then discarded. The
valves or switches are then free to be operated as needed.

2 SIGNS

All signs should be kept current at all times. Permanent

signs, 1f not applicable, should be removed or covered until they

again are applicable. When temporary signs are installed, the

reason for the sign should be clearly stated, signed, and dated.

13 MATNTENANCE AND CHANGES

Responsibilities of the MSRE operations group with regard to main-
tenance include recognizing the need, requesting the necessary work,
and coordinating operations and maintenance. The maintenance group
of the MSRE staff will schedule and arrange for the necessary materials
and manpower to do the work.

Becavse the MSRE is an experiment, operation will inevitably show
the need for some changes. These will be approved, made, and documented
with care equal to that exercised in the original design.

This section contains procedures whose object is to insure that
maintenance and changes are made in an orderly, efficient, and safe

manner.

13A MAINTENANCE

DEFINITION

 

Maintenance means repair or replacement of defective compo-

nents, cervicing of equipment, and alterations or additions which

do not come under the definition of modifications given in 13B.

PROCEDURE

The following procedure applies to all maintenance except for

emergencies which require immediate "first-aid."

2.1 Initial Request

 

2.

The initial request Tor maintenance 1s made through the
Punch List. Anyone seeing a need for maintenance describes
it on a punch list form (Fig. 13.1), available in the reactor
control room. The following instructions apply to filling
out the punch list form:

(a) Enter date of request.

(b) Describe location, equipment and work as specifically
as possible, using sketches where they would clarify
the request.

(c) At end of description, state when the job needs to
be finished.

(d) List any precautions known to be needed.

(e) Sign on line above "SIGNED."

Normally the requestor leaves the completed form on the
punch list clipboard in the reactor control room. If a high
priority is needed, the requestor contacts the Operations
Chief (0C) or Assistant Operations Chief (AOC) to expedite
action.

Handling by Operations Group

 

The Shift Supervisor periodically reviews the punch 1list
and assigns suitable jobs to shift craftsmen. A job 1s suit-
able for this type of handling if the job is straightforward,
has nc wide-reaching effects and can be handled by the shift

craftsmen without interference with thelr primary functilon,

which is to take care of emergency or essential work.

At the beginning of each day shift, the OC or AOC reviews
the punch list and removes jobs which will not be done by
shift craftsmen. He puts aside requesgts which he cannot
approve and notifies the requestor of the reasons for denying
approval. He signs the punch list forms for approved requests,
checks priorities and passes the forms on to the MSRE Mainte=
nance Supervisor. Priority may be one of these three:

(a) Urgent

The work is or could become the critical path
and should be completed as soon as possible.

(b) Medium

The work should be completed as soon as it can
be done without delaying work having an URGENT prior-
ity.

(¢) Low

The scheduling of this work is at the convenience
of the craft groups.
Execution of Simple Jobs

"Simple" here means that the job is not hazardous to the
craftsmen, does not interfere with reactor operations, and
does not otherwise require extensive arrangements. No form
other than the punch list is used for these jobs. The pro-
cedure is as follows.

(a) The Maintenance Supervisor checks that the priority
is in line with other work in progress, and resolves
any conflict with the OC or AOC.

(b) If necessary, the Maintenance Supervisor checks that
the required material is available.

(¢) The Maintenance Supervisor addresses the punch list
form and turns it over to the executing group (nor-
mally P and E or I and C).

(d) Immediately after the work is finished, the craft

foreman initials the form and returns it to the

10/21/65

(d) (continued)
Maintenance Supervisor.

(e) The Maintenasnce Supervisor checks the job, marks the
punch 1list form "completed" and returns it to the
control room.

2.4t Execution of Complicated Jobs

 

A job is "complicated" if it could interfere with the
operation of the reactor or is hazardous. A form called
"MSRE Work Request” (Fig. 13.2) is used in connection with
this type Jjob. The procedure is as follows.

(a) The Maintenance Supervisor checks the priority as in

(b) The reactor maintenance group assigns & work request
number and enters tThis on the Work Request form along
with a description based on the punch 1list description.
Where necessary, 'CAUTION - CHECK WITH OPERATIONS
BEFORE PROCEEDING" is stamped on the work request.

The original of the work request is held in the
Maintenance Supervisor's file; coples are made as
necessary. One copy of the work request goes to the
craft group involved, one to the AOC and one to the
oC.

(c) The Maintenance Supervisor, after consultation with
the executing craft group, estimates the time required
and passes this information on to the Operations Chief.

(d) The OC reviews the request, initials his copy and
passes it on to the MSRE Shift Supervisor.

(e} If the job has a high priority, the Maintenance
Supervisor coordinstes preparations of the craft
group and operations. Otherwise the craft super-
vision will schedule the wecrk on the basis of re-
quested date of completion, relative priorities of
other jobs, and available manpower. In such cases

the craft supervision notifies the Shift Supervisor

(f) Before work starts, the MSRE Shift Supervisor will
make necessary preparations such as shutting down
machinery, closing valves and opening switches. He
uses MSRE tags where advantageous, and attaches the
white copy of the tag to the Control Room copy of
the work request. (MSRE tags and their use are
described in Section 12E.)

(g) When all preparations have been made, the Shift
Supervisor signs control room copy and the crafts-
man's copy of the work request, permitting the crafts
to proceed.

Columns are provided for indicating when the
work can be started and when the work must be com-
pleted or stopped. The shift supervisor enters this
information and any additional precautions or restric-
tions on the craftman's copy as well as the control
room copy.

(h) As soon as the work is completed, inspected, and
approved by craft supervision and the MSRE Mainte-
nance Supervisor, the signed copy is turned over to
the Shift Supervisor.

(1) The Shift Supervisor removes tags, compares these
with the white slips attached to the WR, and makes
an operational check of the job.

e changes control room copies of affected
drawings and indicates this on the work request and
briefly states what was done to check out the job.
The work requests are then turned over to the
Assistant Operations Chief or Operations Chief.
Should the operatilional check show that more work
needs to be done, the Shift Supervisor contacts the

Maintenance Supervisor who arranges for the completion

13B MODIFICATIONS

1 DEFINITTION

A modification is defined as = change in the physical plant

 

which produces a significantly different characteristic or function
in any component or systenl.
2 PROCEDURE
2.1 Redquest
A person should formally request any modification which
he believes to be worthwhile or to possess advantages at least
worth considering. The requestor describes the change on an
MSRE Change Request Form (Fig. 12.3) and submits it to the
MSRE Design Liaison Engineer.
2.2 Review
No modification will be made before adequate review and
approval. To insure that all aspects are considered, a per-
son responsible for each area affected by the change will be
asked to review and approve the change. The MSRE Operations
Department Head will review all requests and will determine
what other reviewers are necessarys.
When the Design Liaison Engineer (DLE) receives a request,
he assigns it a2 number. He then has the request typed on a
Change Request Form. A copy of the typed request goes to the
MSRE Project Director for his consideration. The typed re-
quest goes to the Department Head, who checks the appropriate
boxes under "Approval to Proceed"” and routes the request to
reviewers in the MSRE area (Buildings 7503 and 7509). When
the internal review is completed, the form comes back to the
DLE, who sends it out for external reviews which may be
required. After external reviews, the request is again
returned to the DLE. He sends a copy of the request, with
approvels and comments of the reviewers, TO the Reactor

Division Director for his information.

Any reviewer may either approve or not and may suggest
alternatives. If he disapproves he should indicate his reasons
under "Comments"” or on a separate gheet which becomes part of
the request. The reviewer may register his views on alterna-
tives in the same way.

The DLE will maintain a file of change requests whicia
will reveal the status of all requests at any time.

Action

If all reviewers approve a change, the DLE will arrange
for necessary desgign work; on jobs requiring no design, he
will arrange with the MSRE Maintenance Supervisor to get the
work done. Changes not unanimously approved or for which
alternatives are proposed must be arbitrated. The DLE will
attempt to obtain agreement, but if this is impossible the
MSRE Department Head or the Project Director will decide what
to do about the change.

On change requests where only the desired result is
specified, "Approval the Proceed" means merely that the re-
viewer approves study or design of means to the desired end.
Responsibilities for design will be listed under "Assigrments. "
After the design is completed, the MSRE Department Head or the
Project Director must approve the design before the change is
actually made.

When a modification is completed, the DLE is responsible
for seeing that affected documents are changed. Changes in
Control Room documents will be made by the MSRE Operations

Chief or his assilgstant.

13C CHANGES IN OPERATING PROCEDURES

These operating procedures are for the instruction of and routine
use by reactor operators; the copies being put vo this use must, there-
fore, be kept up-to-date, reflecting changes in the system or in ils
operation. Changes must be made only after adequate review and approval,
and it must be possible to tell if a copy contains alli autiiorized changes.
The procedure described in the following paragraphs is aimed at this goal.

The operating procedures used during prenuclear testing were written
by members of the MSRE Operations Department, most of whom had partici-
pated in the design arnd development of the MSRE. A review of existing,
tried procedures was made after Run PC-1 by the operating engineers, and
recommended changes were incorporated as approved by the Operations Chilef.
After Run 3, all sections of the Operating Procedures were completed and
approved, and copies were issued. Copies were elther bound or loose-
leaf, according to the needs of the recipients.

There is one loose-leaf copy of the Operating Procedures, the Master
Copy, in which changes are made only by the Operations Chief (or the
Assistant Operations Chief acting in his stead). The Master Copy is kept
in the Operations Office (Room 3, Building 7503). Eech of the four crews
has a Crew Copy, in which changes are made only by the Shift Supervisor.

Anyone seeing the need for a change in the Operating Procedures
submits a request to the Operations Chief on an MSRE Change Request Form.
A brief description of the purpose of and justification for the change
must go on the form.

The Operations Chief reviews each request and may ask others to
review it and give théir approval or advice. If he approves a change,
the Operations Chief enters the change in the Master Copy and notifies
the Shift Supervisors by means of a list on the Control Room Bulletin
Board. The list includes date of change, location (page mimbers ), brief
description of change, whether or not revised pages will be issued, and
a place for each Shift Supervisor to initial.

As soon as possible after notice of a change is posted, each shift

supervisor will study the change in the Master Copy. If the change 1s
Approved by125:5;222’%?2§gfﬁgzﬁ1 130-2

brief, he will write in the change in the Crew Copy of the Operating
Procedures. (An up-to-date Crew Copy will be maintained by each crew
for its information and use.) If it is a lengthy change, the Shift
Supervisor will circle with red pencil the superseded portion in the
Crew Copy and mark it "Revised -- See Master,” with the date. The
Shift Bupervisor will then instruct his crew with regard to the change.
After each crew member has been instructed and has read the change, the
Shift Supervisor will initial the change list on the bulletin board.
When revised sheets are distributed, marked pages in the Crew Copy will
be replaced by the Shift Supervisor.

Whether or not revised sheets are issued depends mainly on the
length of the change. If a change can be easily and clearly transcribed
by the Shift Supervisors to the Crew Copies, retyping and issuing re-
vised pages is not compulsory or desirable. If pages are retyped, copies
will be sent to persons who need to have an up-to-date version of the
Procedures.

Every page of the Operating Procedures has the approval and date
at the top, as on this page. Revised pages bear the revision date; this
applies to retyped pages and also to marked pages in the Master Copy and
Crew Copies, where the date is changed when the change is written in.
Holders of loose-leaf copies of the Procedures can tell if their copy

ig up-to-date by comparing page dates with those in the Master Copy.

13D CHANGES IN COMPUTER PROGRAM

One of the advantages of the computer-logger over conventional
recorders is that its functions can be readily changed to meet the
changing needs of the Reactor Experiment or to improve the operation
of the computer. Changes in the computer program are made by a pro-
grammer after proper approval.

Anyone recognizing the need for a change, describes it on a Change
Request Form. Requests from the Operations Group ge first to the
Operations Chief; others send their requests to the head of the Nuclear
and Mechanical Analysis Group of the MSRE Operations Department. Re-
guests are handled as described in Section 3H of the Operating Pro-

cedures.

13E REVISION OF APPROVED DOCUMENTS

The MSRE has been the subject of many documents of all kinds, many
of them preliminary and now out-of-date. "Approved documents' are those
which are intended to give an accurate, up-to-date description of the
MSRE and its operation. Because the operator needs to make use of these
documents in training and operation, they must be revised to keep up as
nearly as is practical with changes in the system.

A set of up-to-date approved documents will be kept on file at the
MSRE. They include:

(&) all published parts of the MSRE Design and Operations Report,

(b) drawings,

(c) instrument application tabulations,

(d) instrument specifications,

(e) switch tabulations,

(f) line schedule,

(g) thermocouple tabulations,

(h) design data sheets.

Revision of these documents to reflect modifications in the system
is routinely handled as part of the procedure for modifications (Section
13B, These Procedures). Other revisions will be in the nature of correc-
tions. Anyone discovering an error or recognizing a need to bring an
approved document up-to-date should notify the MSRE Department Head in
writing of the regquired change. He will arrange for errata sheets or

other corrections.
